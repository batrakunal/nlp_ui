 PREFACE
 In 1994, then Secretary of Defense William Perry directed the military
 services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) to begin the pro-
 cess of reinventing their acquisition systems and policies. ",0.8705177451802496,2,2
16," One of the
 most important elements of the “Perry Initiatives” was the elimina-
 tion of all military specifications (milspecs) and standards from use
 in military acquisition. ",0.730820308422018,3,0
17," At the request of the Army, this study exam-
 ines three policy questions:
 •
 Is military specification and standard reform being implemented
 successfully by Army acquisition bureaucrats?
 •
 What factors or determinants affect the willingness and ability of
 Army acquisition employees to implement milspec and standard
 reform?
 •
 Having assessed implementation to date and understanding bet-
 ter what determines bureaucratic behavior, how can the Army
 best affect the underlying beliefs and perceptions of its personnel
 in order to influence behavior in support of milspec and stan-
 dard reform?
 To address these questions, this study applies a theoretical model of
 volitional behavior—called the theory of planned behavior (TPB)—to
 bureaucratic behavior in the Army. ",1.1659163440622087,3,8
18," Based on information developed
 through expert interviews, a survey of Army personnel, and the ap-
 plication of the TPB model, the study presents a series of compre-
 hensive recommendations on how to improve current implementa-
 tion efforts.",1.0189481088024521,3,1

 SUMMARY
 Recent efforts to “reinvent” government have extended to the ac-
 quisition system of the Department of Defense (DoD). ",0.6814500486048461,9,1
44," In 1994, then
 Secretary of Defense William Perry directed the military services
 (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) to begin the process of
 reinventing their acquisition systems and policies. ",0.7336676389806331,10,2
45," An important el-
 ement of the “Perry Initiatives” was the elimination of all military
 specifications (milspecs) and standards from use in military acquisi-
 tion. ",0.6633063785719906,10,0
46," Traditional milspecs and standards were to be replaced with
 performance-based specifications.",0.9387018338817867,10,4
47,"
 The Department of the Army (Army) took the lead in implementing
 the new policy, directing its employees to discontinue using all mil-
 specs and standards. ",0.9585857136070658,10,1
48," By late 1994, however, Army leadership found
 resistance to this policy from within the acquisition work force.",0.7084371017303863,10,1
49,"
 Although the directive appeared clear—eliminate all milspecs and
 standards from use—Army leadership noted that milspecs and stan-
 dards were still finding their way into requests for proposals (RFPs)
 and statements of work (SOWs) at the core of the acquisition process.",1.0289859099780343,10,0
50,"
 Having adopted the initiatives and seeking to implement them fully,
 Army leadership was interested in learning why the rank and file of
 the acquisition work force was not embracing the reforms. ",0.8617009437082841,10,0
51," In addi-
 tion, the Army was interested in identifying ways to “incentivize” or
 improve implementation of milspec and standard reform.",0.9977557418761915,10,0
52,"
 Based on information developed through expert interviews, a survey
 of Army personnel, and the application of a theoretical model of
 volitional behavior—called the theory of planned behavior (TPB)—
 this study identifies the key determinants of reform behavior, as-
 xiv
 Changing Bureaucratic Behavior:   Acquisition Reform in the U.S. Army
 sesses current implementation policies, and offers a series of rec-
 ommendations for improving them.",1.0872015794197534,10,0
53,"
 As the theory of planned behavior predicts, bureaucratic behavior in
 the Army turns out to be a direct function of behavioral intentions to
 reform and perceived behavioral control (institutional rules). ",0.6896787557059667,11,9
54," It is
 also an indirect result of attitudes (self-interest) and subjective
 norms (social controls). ",0.653124272168243,11,9
55," Therefore, this study argues that Army ef-
 forts to promote reform behavior within the acquisition work force
 should focus first on increasing the intentions of the work force to
 reform. ",0.9511813522993131,11,0
56," This is accomplished by changing their attitudes and sub-
 jective norms. ",0.6225960585005845,11,3
57," Second, acquisition personnel will be more likely to
 behave in accordance with reform if they believe that the institutions
 and the environment facilitate the elimination of milspecs and stan-
 dards.",0.6885794832068272,11,0
58,"
 This study further demonstrates that variations in reform behavior
 across the work force are a function of personal factors, such as an
 employee’s career group, experience, organizational affiliation, and
 training. ",0.7983839809154112,11,8
59," Specifically, when compared to military members of the
 acquisition work force—who are the most supportive of reform—
 three civilian career groups (engineering, quality assurance, and
 logistics) show less intent to eliminate milspecs and standards and
 ultimately exhibit less reform behavior. ",0.972560352107647,11,0
60," Similar results are found for
 employees with over 20 years’ experience as compared to those with
 under 20 years’ experience:  the former have more negative attitudes
 toward milspec and standard reform. ",0.543329814160393,11,3
61," Conversely, employees affili-
 ated with the program management office have higher attitude and
 subjective norm values when compared to those affiliated with
 matrix organizations. ",0.5150564182442348,11,7
62," Finally, employees who attended Road Show
 IV, a training program focusing on procedures to eliminate milspecs
 and standards, and employees who have received Integrated Product
 Team (IPT) training have stronger (higher and more supportive) atti-
 tude values. ",0.9403986366260841,11,8
63," Attending traditional acquisition management courses
 appears to have no effect on attitude, subjective norm, or perceived
 behavioral control.",0.5202768271388815,11,8
64,"
 While these conclusions provide valuable information on how the
 determinants of reform behavior vary across the work force, and thus
 the location of resistance within the work force, they do not tell us
 Summary
 xv
 why the attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control
 values of these groups differ. ",0.7691255657755116,11,8
65," To develop this information, this study
 examines how underlying beliefs and perceptions about milspec and
 standard reform vary between different elements of the work force.",0.7388822740466915,12,8
66,"
 First, with respect to  attitudes  of the work force toward reform, the
 study finds the following:
 •
 Those with positive attitudes toward reform (military and con-
 tracting personnel) tend to believe that positive outcomes, such
 as a reduction in program costs or an increase in product quality,
 will result from milspec and standard reform. ",1.181422458713803,12,8
67," Those with nega-
 tive attitudes are less willing to believe that these positive out-
 comes are likely. ",0.3998187133502023,12,3
68," Similarly, those with positive attitudes are less
 willing to believe that negative outcomes (such as an increase in
 long-term life cycle costs) will result from reform, while those
 with a negative attitude see these outcomes as more likely.",0.9226291223264295,12,3
69,"
 •
 Nonmilitary personnel (engineering, quality assurance, and lo-
 gistics personnel) tend to value the goals of reform (or desired
 outcomes such as a reduction in program costs and/or attracting
 commercial firms to defense work) less, contributing to their
 more negative attitude toward milspec reform.",1.0354104703460545,12,8
70,"
 •
 Differences in attitude between military and nonmilitary em-
 ployees relate largely to differences in beliefs related to pro-
 grammatic outcomes (such as product quality and cost), rather
 than personal outcomes (such as an increase in workload or a
 reduction in personal authority).",0.9395549160785067,12,8
71,"
 •
 The relatively more negative attitude of personnel with over 20
 years’ experience (compared to those with under 20 years’ expe-
 rience) is related to their belief that sustainment will be made
 more difficult as a result of reform.",0.8402510751036959,12,7
72,"
 •
 The relatively more negative attitude of matrix personnel
 (compared to program management personnel) is related to
 their belief that milspec reform will not result in reductions in
 program costs and is likely to reduce their authority in the ac-
 quisition process.",0.988648866938602,12,8
73,"
 xvi
 Changing Bureaucratic Behavior:   Acquisition Reform in the U.S. Army
 Second, with respect to the impact of  social controls  on reform
 behavior, the study finds the following:
 •
 Military personnel are more likely to view various referent groups
 as supportive of reform, while the nonmilitary career groups
 (with the exception of contracting personnel) are more likely to
 view referents as opposed to reform. ",1.0176656410953306,12,8
74," Negative attitudes are most
 pronounced in the quality assurance group.",0.6818642042991396,13,3
75,"
 •
 Immediate referents (such as supervisors, program managers,
 and co-workers) are viewed as less supportive of reform by the
 civilian career groups and the matrix personnel in general.",0.7449265631390629,13,7
76,"
 •
 Military personnel are more likely to view Army acquisition lead-
 ers (Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development
 and Acquisition; and Program Executive Officers) as supportive
 of reform and are generally more willing to comply with these
 leaders than are civilian employees (engineering, quality assur-
 ance, and logistics personnel).",1.03812958040649,13,1
77,"
 •
 Matrix personnel are more motivated to comply with matrix
 leadership on reform issues.",0.9623287719442329,13,0
78,"
 Third, with respect to  institutional rules,  the study finds the follow-
 ing:
 •
 Nonmilitary employees (engineering, quality assurance, and lo-
 gistics personnel) perceive environmental and organizational
 factors as more constraining of their ability to eliminate milspecs
 and standards. ",0.9811486047780508,13,8
79," Military personnel view these factors as facilitat-
 ing reform behavior.",0.38071297554432093,13,7
80,"
 •
 Specifically, civilians view reform policy factors (such as the
 training provided, information on how to eliminate milspecs and
 standards, the discretion provided, and information on how to
 work without milspecs and standards) as inadequate or con-
 straining of the ability to eliminate milspecs.",0.9451223956518282,13,0
81,"
 •
 Civilians also view environmental factors (such as acquisition
 laws, availability of funds, acquisition regulations, standard op-
 erating procedures, time available, the skills of others, and the
 human resources available) as more constraining of reform be-
 havior than do military personnel.",0.9049765151083343,13,0
82,"
 Summary xvii
 Finally, the study assesses the effects of training on the underlying
 beliefs and perceptions contributing to reform attitude and subjec-
 tive norm. ",0.7690403713777411,13,8
83," The following conclusions emerge from this analysis:
 •
 Employees who have attended IPT and Road Show IV training
 are more likely to believe that milspec reform will result in posi-
 tive outcomes (such as a reduction in program costs). ",1.1981861671368677,14,8
84," These be-
 liefs support a more positive attitude toward the elimination of
 milspecs and standards.",0.4145383822516945,14,3
85,"
 •
 IPT training appears to convince participants that important ref-
 erents (such as immediate referents and Army leadership) are
 supportive of milspec reform. ",0.715914064164957,14,0
86," It also appears to improve their
 motivation to comply with these referents.",0.637574761347729,14,9
87,"
 •
 Participation in Road Show IV does not appear to affect the
 underlying beliefs and perceptions that determine subjective
 norms or perceptions of behavioral control. ",0.5555174173219604,14,3
88," Participation in IPT
 training does not affect the underlying beliefs and perceptions
 that determine perceptions of behavioral control. ",0.5354124772750517,14,3
89," Traditional
 acquisition management courses have no effect on the under-
 lying determinants of reform-related attitude, subjective norm,
 or perceived behavioral control.",0.71752679193725,14,9
90,"
 Clearly, if Army leadership efforts to generate greater support for mil-
 spec and standard reform and greater employee compliance with the
 directive to eliminate milspecs and standards are to be successful,
 they must seek to change the underlying beliefs and perceptions of
 civilian employees. ",0.981418552787612,14,0
91," This can be done by bringing civilian beliefs into
 greater alignment with the beliefs of the more supportive and com-
 pliant elements of the acquisition work force—namely, military and
 contracting personnel. ",0.7075662264306352,14,0
92," Specifically, the study recommends that the
 Army (1) use and improve existing training programs—IPT and Road
 Show IV training—to change reform attitude, subjective norm, and
 perceived behavioral control, and (2) target implementation efforts
 to the resistant elements of the work force, focusing on the alignment
 of underlying beliefs and perceptions between those employees who
 are resisting reform and those meeting implementation objectives.",1.370542178718666,14,8

 OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT
 ",0.4983724346443611,18,1
126,"This report addresses three policy questions:
 •
 Are military specification (hereafter called milspec) and standard
 reform being implemented successfully by Army acquisition bu-
 reaucrats?
 •
 What factors or determinants affect the willingness and ability of
 Army acquisition employees to implement milspec and standard
 reform?
 •
 Having assessed implementation to date and understanding bet-
 ter what determines bureaucratic behavior, how can the Army
 best affect the underlying beliefs and perceptions of its personnel
 in order to influence behavior in support of milspec and stan-
 dard reform?
 ",1.0946996731920604,18,8
127,"Ideally, the insights gained by answering these questions will provide
 the Army with more and better information about what motivates its
 employees and affects their behavior. ",0.69741145905902,18,8

 mentation policies can be assessed and improvements suggested.",1.1545022327645613,18,0

 Introduction

 THE THEORETICAL MODEL
 Three sets of factors are hypothesized to affect the willingness and
 ability of Army acquisition employees to implement reform. ",0.8741047207139063,18,8
130," These
 factors are:  (1) employees’ attitudes toward implementing reform;
 (2) employees’ subjective norms—or the perceived effect of the views
 of other social referents (colleagues, superiors, interest groups)—
 toward implementing reform; and (3) employees’ perception of be-
 havioral control—or their perception of how factors beyond their
 control (organizational or environmental factors) affect their ability
 to implement reform. ",0.9028994192363976,19,8
131," These factors form the core of the theory of
 planned behavior (TPB), a widely tested and applied theory from
 social psychology (Ajzen, 1991).",0.5929149953396528,19,9
132,"
 These three key factors—attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
 behavioral control—are themselves determined by a series of beliefs
 and perceptions, or underlying subfactors. ",0.5297289626170724,19,8
133," These subfactors are also
 examined in order to understand better why employees do or do not
 support and implement reform. ",0.9780270297063198,19,0
134," For example, attitudes are derived
 from evaluations of potential consequences that can result from
 specific behaviors. ",0.6153476237623561,19,8
135," If the underlying subfactors related to these con-
 sequences are favorable, a favorable attitude results and an em-
 ployee is more likely to implement reform.",0.7937762443092812,19,8
136,"
 Application of the theory of planned behavior to the problem of re-
 form behavior among Army acquisition employees leads to a behav-
 ioral model that identifies the factors affecting bureaucratic deci-
 sions, predicts bureaucratic behavior, and allows the development of
 conclusions and policy recommendations related to the implemen-
 tation of reform.",1.0008277069044949,19,8

 DATA COLLECTION AND METHODS

 within the Army acquisition bureaucracy. ",0.749721474727962,19,1

 data and observations related to the existing reform efforts, the envi-
 ronment (organizational and otherwise) within which the reforms

 factors postulated to affect behavior. ",0.695606646926254,20,8

 OUTLINE OF THE REPORT
 Chapter Two describes the policy environment within which Army
 reform is taking place. ",0.9024019642909635,20,1
146," The 1990s have seen a rise in public-sector
 reform efforts. ",0.6527162485981667,20,6
147," These efforts, sometimes called “reinventing gov-
 ernment,” try to apply private-sector management techniques to the
 public sector. ",0.5877983562789445,20,1
148," In many respects these reforms call for greater inno-
 vation and discretion on the part of public agencies and their em-
 ployees. ",0.6274942212560021,20,6
149," These same objectives are evident in the Army’s acquisition
 reform efforts. ",0.5310045937930243,20,1
150," While these reforms hold promise, there are concerns
 about the applicability of private-sector techniques for the public
 sector, as well as the formidable bureaucratic barriers that must be
 overcome if they are to operate effectively.",0.6889522112842698,20,0
151,"
 Chapter Three examines two broad theoretical approaches to why
 bureaucracies and bureaucrats operate the way they do across a
 variety of disciplinary boundaries, including public administration,
 political science, organizational theory, and economics. ",0.7025062738607866,20,9
152," Each of the
 theories considers the prime motivation or objective of the bureau-
 crat and his/her organization as being either self-interest or institu-
 tional rules and constraints. ",0.6174546497616301,20,9
153," These theories provide a framework for
 viewing and assessing the functioning of the Army acquisition
 bureaucracy.",0.6798429646208581,20,9
154,"
 Chapter Four outlines the theory of planned behavior and uses it to
 establish a notional model of bureaucratic behavior (Ajzen, 1991).",0.6589271356478742,20,4
155,"
 This model is used to operationalize and test the determinants of
 bureaucratic behavior as they apply in the Army acquisition
 bureaucracy.",0.6983783332206664,20,4
156,"
 Chapter Five first describes the process of data collection, including
 84 field interviews with a wide range of acquisition personnel on
 acquisition reform and milspec and standard reform. ",0.7977512220287821,20,1
157," These data are
 useful for identifying the underlying subfactors that may be impor-

 ceptions of behavioral control. ",0.6329488428585092,20,3
158," The chapter then describes an Army
 acquisition survey administered to 3,000 randomly selected mem-
 bers of the acquisition work force.",0.5373553028878191,21,1
159,"
 Chapter Six provides an initial analysis of the state of support for
 reform, and the state of reform behavior, within the acquisition work
 force. ",0.9683441840521771,21,1
160," It also describes the application of the bureaucratic behavior
 model using the survey data from the Army acquisition work force.",0.68734810914312,21,4
161,"
 This model identifies the importance and relative strength of
 bureaucratic attitudes, subjective norms (beliefs about referents),
 and perceptions of behavioral control (how difficult it will be to re-
 form) in the prediction of bureaucratic behavior. ",0.5516600695613275,21,3
162," In addition, this
 chapter examines how these three factors vary as a function of a
 bureaucrat’s experience, profession, and other individual character-
 istics.",0.5780143746335688,21,8
163,"
 Chapter Seven examines the role of underlying subfactors in the
 formation of bureaucratic attitudes toward milspec and standard
 reform. ",0.42898933362329456,21,9
164," Specifically, the underlying subfactors of those who have a
 favorable attitude toward reform are compared with those employ-
 ees with a less favorable attitude toward reform. ",0.5706373482293974,21,7
165," This comparison
 provides information on why the attitudes of these groups differ and
 helps us understand why their behavior might differ as well.",0.6024720975069929,21,8
166,"
 Chapter Eight examines another set of underlying subfactors and
 their impact on the subjective norms held by Army acquisition em-
 ployees—or what bureaucrats believe important referents want them
 to do. ",0.6328154579827242,21,3
167," Specifically, this chapter examines how different members of
 the acquisition work force view important referent groups. ",0.5490062352978775,21,8
168," Do some
 groups believe specific referents support reform while others view
 these referents as opposed? ",0.6908884979717392,21,0
169," Comparing the underlying subfactors of
 those employees with a positive subjective norm to those with a
 negative subjective norm may make it possible to better understand
 why behaviors differ.",0.7586551391963319,21,3
170,"
 Chapter Nine examines the role of underlying subfactors in the for-
 mation of perceptions of behavioral control—or how difficult
 bureaucrats anticipate the actual elimination of milspecs and stan-
 dards to be. ",0.4950388316353936,21,9
171," Specifically, this chapter compares beliefs about what
 makes reform hard or easy between those employees who think it

 will be easy and those who think it will be hard. ",0.8963024584972816,21,9
172," Once again, this
 comparison should help us to better understand how perceptions of
 control differ and why behavior may vary among elements of the
 Army acquisition work force.",0.7577910874413742,22,8
173,"
 Chapter Ten examines how different training programs affect the
 underlying subfactors analyzed in Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine.
 ",0.6400692323028352,22,4
174,"Specifically, it examines whether or not employees who have been
 trained have different underlying subfactors than those who have not
 been trained, thus identifying the role and usefulness of training in
 changing employee reform behavior.",0.9584704484982897,22,8
175,"
 Finally, Chapter Eleven draws on the information revealed in Chap-
 ters Six through Ten to develop a comprehensive set of recommen-
 dations on how the implementation of milspec and standard reform
 can be improved to better motivate employees to engage in reform
 behavior.",0.9795713107341892,22,0
176,"
 The appendix presents the analytic methods used to apply the theory
 of planned behavior to the data collected in this study. ",0.9183346263785532,22,4

186," It is
 often hoped that this efficiency will be gained by using private-sector
 management techniques. ",0.5749832765946816,24,0

 efforts for reforming the Army acquisition system, the current policy
 environment in Washington has definitely contributed to favorable
 trends toward acquisition reform.",0.5777562935380626,24,1
189,"
 The Shifting Paradigm of Public Administration
 Current concerns over the cost of government services, and the po-
 tential for waste in their provision, have increased the importance of
 efficiency for government officials and the public. ",0.844045577374761,24,0
190," But in many
 respects the shift to managing for efficiency in the public sector
 requires the elimination of rules and procedures put in place to
 assure fairness and equity in public administration.",0.6679822387030853,24,9
191,"
 A case in point is public acquisition and procurement. ",0.4772723557098273,24,1
192," Many aspects
 of the government procurement system are complicated and bur-
 densome compared to the contracting/supply relationships of
 private-sector firms. ",0.516017297545334,24,9

 such as detailed product specifications, government standards, open
 and fair competition, recompetition, and even federal procurement
 laws, differ markedly from private practice. ",0.7352903043565182,24,0
194," They could potentially
 increase the cost of goods procured by the government and the cost
 of providing goods to the government. ",0.9210293752779897,24,7

 focus of Vice President Gore’s National Performance Review (NPR),
 which emphasized simplifying a complicated and burdensome
 process. ",0.8568174190654788,24,1

 management or outdated procedures, some are probably the price of
 an equitable process. ",0.7414297851802347,24,7

 control fraud, abuse, and graft within the process.",0.7762352610567134,24,0

 focus heavily on providing bureaucrats with more discretion to make
 decisions and to be entrepreneurial. ",0.7919267287828146,25,0

 current bureaucratic structures limit the ability, opportunity, and",0.5832773684734932,25,3

 empowerment of federal employees a reality, major changes will be

 ACQUISITION REFORM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
 One of the largest federal agencies and the largest federal purchaser
 of goods and services is the Department of Defense (DoD). ",0.6274049041385826,25,2
206," Its size,
 role in the economy, and reputation (fair or unfair) as a source of
 government waste and abuse make DoD an obvious target for
 reinvention. ",0.6211204852774915,25,6
207," Indeed, efforts to apply private-sector remedies to
 bureaucratic ills have taken hold at DoD.  Under past and current
 leadership, DoD is moving to commercialize its operations and to
 empower its employees, particularly in the area of defense procure-
 ment.",0.7188480829034434,25,0
208,"
 The most recent effort to reform defense procurement focuses on
 lowering costs both for the government and its contractors, rather
 than simply emphasizing the prevention of fraud, abuse, and mis-
 management as with previous reform efforts. ",0.9187110750217412,25,0
209," In addition, this round
 of reform emphasizes efficiency, seeking to reengineer internal
 processes and relationships underlying the existing acquisition sys-
 tems of the DoD and the military services:  the Air Force, Army, and
 Navy/Marine Corps (hereafter referred to as the services). ",0.6901978104186507,25,1

 respects the current DoD reforms seek to mirror efforts to reinvent

 A variety of initiatives and reforms are under way within DoD.  The
 one addressed in this study concerns the perceived need to unfetter
 the acquisition system from excessive rules, regulations, and re-
 quirements. ",0.9314065306169054,26,0
212," Specifically, it calls for the discontinuation of the use of
 military-unique specifications and standards in acquisition and pro-
 curement. ",0.5961612891941055,26,0
213," These specifications and standards are a major element
 of the DoD procurement process. ",0.5495807460124323,26,0
214," Specifications generally refer to
 products and their desired performance attributes; standards gen-
 erally refer to processes and techniques used to construct/build
 products to specification. ",0.9067517424433554,26,4
215," In short, they tell DoD contractors what
 products to build, and in many cases how to build them.",0.6472908002304247,26,0
216,"
 Defense-unique military specifications (milspecs) and standards are
 commonly viewed as onerous, complex, costly, and in some
 instances outdated. ",0.6284485378232603,26,6
217," To shore up its industrial base with traditionally
 commercial firms and gain access to their advanced technologies,",0.47707366513148164,26,6

 DoD elected to try to make it easier to engage in the defense busi-
 ness. ",0.552235598809866,26,6
219," Toward this goal, the 1994 report  Blueprint for Change:  To-
 ward a National Production Base  calls for the elimination of military
 specifications and standards in defense acquisition:  that is, greater
 use of performance specifications defining a product based on its
 performance requirements and less use of how-to specifications
 telling a contractor which materials, process, and so on must be used
 in providing a good or service.",1.216502622790748,26,0
220,"
 This is a major change for a system that has been built on rigid mil-
 specs and standards designed to assure quality and performance.",1.0178882567096552,26,0
221,"
 Indeed, by early 1995, Army leadership began expressing concerns
 that the motivations, incentives, and objectives of personnel in the
 field may not coincide fully with the objectives of the reforms. ",0.8481293680694041,26,0
222," As
 one example, even though program offices were directed to elimi-
 nate milspecs and standards from all requests for proposals (RFPs)
 and statements of work (SOWs) on new Army contracts, RFPs and
 SOWs were still being written with milspecs and standards included.",0.9592524235425306,26,1

 Managerial Constraints

 administration. ",0.8381796039385186,27,0

 Changing Bureaucratic Behavior:  Acquisition Reform in the U.S. Army
 THEORETICAL APPROACH ONE:  SELF-INTEREST
 To understand the behavior of an entire bureaucracy, many scholars
 have focused on the behavior of individual bureaucrats. ",0.6984931583890219,29,9
263," These
 bureaucrats are seen as boundedly rational individuals making deci-
 sions based on self-interest maximization in a complex professional
 environment. ",0.6167109442991915,30,9
264," Conceptualizing bureaucrats as individuals who base
 decisions on their perceived self-interests has led to a series of ever
 more complex hypotheses on what these self-interests are, what
 exactly bureaucrats seek to maximize, and how this affects bureau-
 cracies and their behavior. ",0.5727338421677348,30,3
265," Within these theoretical approaches, self-
 interest and the goals that make it up vary depending on where the
 bureaucrat sits within the organization, and what personal charac-
 terstics he or she brings to the job.",0.6153034145120639,30,8
266,"
 ",0.0,30,-1
267,"The Budget-Maximizing Bureaucrat
 Extending the self-interest perspective on bureaucratic behavior,
 others have theorized that bureaucrats seek to maximize their agen-
 cy’s discretionary budgets. ",0.6825286198505919,30,6
268," While agreeing that bureaucrats hold a
 variety of personal goals, each of these goals is attainable through in-
 creasing the agency’s discretionary budget. ",0.6281841297154241,30,6

 crat’s self-interest to work toward budget maximization. ",0.6184883690695231,30,6
270," It is as-

 ",0.0,30,-1
273,"This budget-maximizing perspective applies to agency executives or
 senior bureaucrats; it does not attempt to define or predict the be-
 havior of lower-level bureaucrats. ",0.8172857253246418,30,7

 employees at the higher levels of a bureaucracy value relatively more
 the organizational goals for which they are more or less directly re-
 sponsible. ",0.6161567182581312,30,8

 Examining Divergent Interests
 At the center of the self-interest approach to bureaucratic behavior is
 the conflict between the personal goals of bureaucrats and the goals
 of the organization they serve. ",0.5380233912896096,31,9
278," To the extent that individual bureau-
 crats share the goals and objectives of the organization, an agency
 can expect its employees to act in a manner consistent with those
 objectives. ",0.722794710995494,31,0
279," When personal and organizational goals coincide, the or-
 ganization is likely to be more efficient—experiencing less shirking
 and non-value-added activity.",0.6353977227665384,31,8
280,"
 Differences in these factors—goals, uncertainty, perceptions, and
 information—are most likely to be found between upper- and lower-
 level members of an organization. ",0.6507231462192857,31,8
281," Once at the top of an organiza-
 tion, bureaucrats are likely to find themselves more directly respon-
 sible for agency outcomes—thus their interests and likely their
 perceptions of reality can be expected to coincide more with the
 organization. ",0.6187633136816472,31,8
282," In addition, senior managers have more information
 on agency goals, objectives, and plans. ",0.7467903452792546,31,0
283," This information lowers the
 amount of uncertainty they face—lessening divergent interests.",0.42995946471383006,31,6
284,"
 There is greater conflict and goal divergence within the lower ranks
 of a bureaucracy because this is where working bureaucrats must
 reconcile organizational rules with the realities of service delivery
 and their operating environment. ",0.652659602247901,31,9
285," The lower-level workers are more
 or less separated from organizational objectives. ",0.5567509456286073,31,7
286," So in some types of
 agencies, at the bottom of the organization, objectives can appear
 more abstract and the rules protecting them less applicable, thus al-
 lowing greater bureaucrat discretion and greater goal divergence.",0.7309797895803098,31,9
287,"
 Organizations can be classified based on the observability (usually to
 agency managers) of their outputs and outcomes (Wilson, 1989).",0.6316757369128309,31,7
288,"
 Outputs are the things an agency or its employees do to achieve or-

 Control, Compliance, and the Principal-Agent Framework
 Self-interest explanations of bureaucratic behavior ultimately lead to
 the development of ways to better assure the overlap of personal and
 organizational interests. ",0.8347579889491143,32,0

 THEORETICAL APPROACH TWO:  INSTITUTIONAL RULES

 in, rather than to their self-interest-determined behavior. ",0.5430244001219626,32,9

 theories present a view that situational constraints—such as bureau
 rules, and external oversight and control—dictate behavior. ",0.6835371937942674,32,9

 Internal Controls
 Internal controls are put in place by the institution or organization to
 control or influence the behavior of employees. ",0.7419279042438575,32,9
306," They include:
 •
 Internal regulations and standard operating procedures, which
 are at times legally binding and can have a major impact on how
 work is conducted and how bureaucrats behave;
 •
 Facilitating policies, which are often human resources policies
 designed to educate, train, and motivate employees to perform
 desired behaviors; and
 •
 Organizational culture, which can develop around how those
 goals are to be attained.",1.2265655031515963,33,8
307,"
 External Controls
 Many of the constraints that are now an integral part of an agency’s
 operating environment are externally generated. ",0.799970032960426,33,0
308," There are basically
 three categories of external control:
 •
 Laws and regulations imposed by Congress on the conduct of
 public management, which constrain and affect bureaucratic
 behavior;
 •
 Congressional controls on agency budgets, which can affect the
 behavior of an organization by either constraining or facilitating
 its ability to fulfill its mission; and
 •
 The Civil Service system of rigid hierarchical controls, which
 provides the framework within which the bureaucracy is re-
 cruited, trained, promoted, and managed.",1.1011312438547385,33,0

 Social Controls
 Social controls can be both internally and externally derived. ",0.5444088334001289,33,9
310," Unlike
 the internal and external controls described above, social controls
 are driven by social relationships and networks and form two distinct
 categories:

 •
 Interest group pressures.",0.8042315418673535,33,9

 dards in determining behavior. ",0.6257549565468282,34,6

 organizational goals or a vague mission, bureaucratic behavior may
 be dictated largely by what is acceptable to key social and peer
 groupings within the organization. ",0.6315706199081773,34,8

 sures that affect a bureau may be reduced to Congress and the pub-

 components of the self-interest calculations of bureaucrats. ",0.484719009103441,37,3

 crats will tend to have a positive attitude toward reform if their self-
 interests are served and reform leads to a perceived positive out-
 come, and a negative attitude if it leads to a negative outcome.",0.623000032120099,37,3
349,"
 Subjective Norms
 Subjective norm is a function of a respondent’s beliefs about the
 normative views and wishes of referents about his/her behavior, and
 each respondent’s motivation to comply with the views and wishes
 of each particular referent. ",0.45862547140156257,37,3
350," The term “referent” is used in this study
 as a general description of other individuals or groups who may have
 an effect on a bureaucrat’s (survey respondent’s) decisions or ac-
 tions. ",0.7438410307529009,37,8
351," Referents might include peers, colleagues, family, and profes-
 sional associations—any person or group to which a bureaucrat may
 refer in making a decision or deciding on a behavior.",0.6859848241331535,37,6
352,"
 As with attitude, subjective norm is often measured in two ways in
 behavioral research, and both measures are used in this study. ",1.0144658638692763,37,8
353," The
 first is a global measure of subjective norm, such as a single-survey
 item asking respondents to indicate whether referents important to
 22

 them desire them to perform a certain behavior. ",0.9611067698448992,37,8
354," The second mea-
 sure of subjective norm is constructed by summing the products of
 normative belief and motivation to comply for all possible referents
 involved in subjective norm formation. ",0.6223735192738375,38,3
355," This is often termed a belief-
 based measure of subjective norm, and it will be indicated in this
 study by the symbol  SN . ",0.7396302932618736,38,4
356," Again, since identification of all possible
 referents and measurement of associated normative beliefs and mo-
 tivations is impossible to do in practice, this form of measurement is
 considered less reliable than the global subjective norm measure.",0.9563043125030681,38,5
357,"
 Nevertheless, TPB researchers often measure subjective norm using
 both approaches. ",0.7876002656582276,38,5
358," These measurements are then correlated to de-
 termine how closely related they are. ",0.641101734183179,38,5
359," If this correlation is perfect
 (i.e., equal to one) then both measures are judged to be interchange-
 able and reliable.",0.5921003453994423,38,5
360,"
 Subjective norm is used to operationalize the portion of the institu-
 tional rules theory of bureaucracy that identifies hierarchy, social
 norms, and interest group pressures as important determinants of
 bureaucratic behavior. ",0.5753917010849214,38,9
361," Hierarchy relates to the impact on behavior
 of the role of superiors and position in the bureaucracy. ",0.39733944470490556,38,9
362," Social
 norms refer to the effect of co-workers/peers and professional inter-
 ests on behavior. ",0.41973274903676483,38,9
363," Interest group pressure relates to the effect of ex-
 ternal actors—Congress, the public, and others with a stake in a
 bureaucrat’s actions—on behavior. ",0.6121283098393718,38,9
364," Each of these function as types
 of social normative control on the bureaucrat’s behavior.",0.569434745984303,38,9

 Perceived Behavioral Control
 The perceived behavioral control factor measures the effect of rules,
 regulations, and other imposed constraints that can control a bu-
 reaucrat’s behavior. ",0.784132807513076,38,3
366," As with attitude and subjective norm, there are
 two methods of measuring perceived behavioral control that are
 used in applying and analyzing behavior with the TPB model. ",0.8350745425065154,38,3
367," The
 first is a global measure of perceived behavioral control, based on a
 single-survey item that asks individuals if performing a certain be-
 havior will be hard or easy for them personally. ",0.8022010312350306,38,3
368," The second measure
 is the belief-based measure of perceived behavioral control, identi-
 fied in this study by the symbol  PBC . ",0.6859621530318003,38,5
369," This measure is the summation
 of all possible control beliefs, and, as with the other belief-based
 measures, the reliability of  PBC  is affected by the difficulty in mea-
 Explaining Bureaucratic Behavior
 23
 suring control beliefs related to all measurable control factors. ",1.0030310772484907,38,8
370," But if
 the global measure of perceived behavioral control is highly corre-
 lated with  PBC,  TPB researchers will use the information on control
 beliefs to better understand why and how perceptions of behavioral
 control differ within the population.",0.7942499515151096,39,8
371,"
 Clearly, the TPB is a useful means of operationalizing the constructs
 included in the theories surveyed previously on bureaucracy and bu-
 reaucratic behavior. ",0.6322151429276934,39,9
372," The attitude factor in the TPB is developed by
 assessing the personal and professional consequences of reform be-
 havior on the respondent. ",0.8575693784285494,39,9
373," Thus, it is a useful factor to operationalize
 the self-interest construct—both for bureaucrats who are personally
 motivated or for those motivated to meet organizational goals. ",0.565748029925179,39,8
374," The
 effects of referents are operationalized through the subjective norm
 factor. ",0.34881687678725326,39,5
375," The role of rules or other factors that constrain or facilitate
 behavior is effectively operationalized by the perceived behavioral
 control factor and to a degree by subjective norm. ",0.5100219417800558,39,8

 UNDERSTANDING REFORM BEHAVIOR
 This chapter addresses three sets of questions:
 •
 What is the current state of support for reform within the acqui-
 sition work force? ",0.9081657607689114,46,0
448," Are employees acting in accordance with
 milspec and standard reform, i.e., are they behaving as desired
 by Army leadership?
 •
 How well do the data collected from the acquisition work force fit
 the TPB model of bureaucratic behavior discussed in Chapter
 Four? ",0.7676568535335575,47,4
449," Is the TPB model able to predict reform behavior within
 the work force, and what can it tell us about which factors are
 important in determining behavior?
 •
 Do the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral
 controls vary in any systematic way across the acquisition work
 force (as might be suggested by bureaucratic theory)?",0.8889504438656526,47,8
450,"
 ASSESSING SUPPORT FOR MILSPEC AND STANDARD
 REFORM AND REFORM BEHAVIOR
 A primary objective of this study is to assess the degree to which mil-
 spec and standard reform is supported and implemented by the
 Army acquisition work force.",1.0424598402937928,47,1
451,"
 In the Army Acquisition Survey, two specific items were included
 related to (1) the level of support a respondent felt toward the policy
 to eliminate all use of milspecs and standards and (2) the degree to
 which a respondent had eliminated milspecs and standards from use
 in RFPs, SOWs, and contracts (a measure of behavior). ",1.137224084775649,47,8
452," Examining

 responses to these items allows an assessment of overall levels of
 support and behavior within the work force. ",0.8756658509524836,47,8
453," They also allow for
 assessment of the relationship between support and behavior, and
 its implications for the modeling approach pursued in this study.",0.8302681542926905,48,8
454,"
 Respondents to the survey were asked to indicate the extent to which
 they agreed or disagreed with the following statement:  “I support the
 elimination of milspecs and standards.” ",0.7081179503079801,48,4
455," The majority of respondents
 (66 percent) supported the reform, and only 34 percent of the re-
 spondents did not support the reform. ",0.6989505320094594,48,7
456," To measure reform behavior,
 respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed
 or disagreed with the following statement:  “I no longer use milspecs
 and standards in my job.” ",0.8577204296547151,48,7
457," Similar to support levels, the majority
 (approximately 65 percent) of the respondents agreed that they had
 eliminated the use of milspecs and standards.",0.7837859625191734,48,7
458,"
 With regard to the relationship between support and behavior, while
 supporters are more likely to comply with the reform than not, sup-
 port is not the only factor affecting behavior. ",0.6786214671383891,48,8
459," This is consistent with
 the theory of planned behavior, which includes the concept of sup-
 port (i.e., the attitude factor) as only one of the factors that ultimately
 determine intentions and behavior; subjective norms and perceived
 behavioral control are the others. ",0.7203938134170563,48,8

 “supportive” of reform, high support levels may not translate readily
 into the desired reform behavior.",0.6670211906534115,48,7

 SUBSTANTIATING THEORIES OF BUREAUCRATIC
 BEHAVIOR
 As discussed previously, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
 behavioral control have a rough correspondence to major theoretical
 explanations of bureaucratic behavior. ",0.4325161363679258,49,3
480," In essence, these theories on
 bureaucracy posit that bureaucratic behavior is primarily the result
 of either self-interest or institutional rules. ",0.38463087769921495,49,9
481," According to the TPB,
 one’s attitude toward a behavior is the result of a calculation of the
 costs and benefits of a behavior. ",0.7168358512246129,49,3
482," Therefore, attitude corresponds to
 self-interest. ",0.2606774920919394,49,6

 actors in the decision to perform a behavior. ",0.8185161165120517,49,3
484," Therefore, subjective
 norm corresponds to the social control element of the institutional
 rules perspective. ",0.5269737472374803,49,9

 The model parameter estimates derived here provide support for
 each of the bureaucratic theories. ",0.8185036173855288,50,5

 social controls, and the internally and externally imposed controls of
 the institutional rules approach—plays a significant role in predict-
 ing reform intention and reform behavior. ",0.6385701881504283,50,9

 relative strength of each factor and how it affects behavior (either
 directly or indirectly through intentions).",0.5891133437565531,50,3

 Self-interest is a strong predictor of bureaucratic behavior through its
 effect on the formation of behavioral intentions. ",0.37613029418607324,50,9

 also contributes to reform intentions. ",0.7115971426301133,50,9

 interest in determining intentions, the views of others (referents) are

 Belief-based measures of attitude do allow the examination of under-
 lying subfactors. ",0.6038787848233397,54,3

 fined as one’s evaluation of whether or not performing a given be-

 Four of the 11 control factors can be described as reform policy fac-
 tors. ",0.9182484156706057,72,0

 Army acquisition system to facilitate or implement broader acquisi-
 tion reform and the elimination of milspecs and standards.",0.7926853812346984,73,0

 The four reform policy factors are the training provided, information
 on how to eliminate milspecs, the discretion provided, and informa-
 tion on how to work without milspecs.",0.8539764088118572,73,0

 groups find these reform policy factors to be inadequate, compared
 to the beliefs of military personnel.",0.6719822647903976,73,7

 Civilians View Environmental Factors as More Constraining
 The remaining control factors can be described as environmental.",0.6419070121054493,73,7
806,"
 These factors represent broader elements or conditions in the ac-
 quisition system that can affect a person’s perception of the ease
 with which milspecs and standards can be eliminated. ",0.6126358138600676,73,8
807," While these
 factors are variable, or changeable, to some degree, in most cases
 their alteration or adjustment tends be outside the control of any
 single actor in the system. ",0.6716948825164194,73,5
808," These control factors include acquisition
 laws, the availability of funds, Army acquisition regulations, standard
 operating procedures in an office, the time available for program
 management, the skills of others, and the human resources available
 for program management.",1.0875581171741084,73,0

 For engineers, QAs, and logisticians, these seven factors are consid-
 ered to make the elimination of milspec and standards harder rather
 than easier. ",0.6002335234517848,73,7

 Road Show IV Training
 The Army’s Road Show process is a training and communication
 program (headed by the Army Materiel Command) directed at the
 upper, middle, and lower levels of the Army acquisition system.",0.8436687845973345,78,1

 communication effort is constructed. ",0.6044620024951202,78,6

 place during 1994 and 1995, was dedicated to training employees
 about the elimination of milspecs and standards, use of IPTs, and
 application of best-value source selection in the acquisition process.",0.8699329569821073,78,0

 USEFULNESS OF TRAINING IN CHANGING REFORM
 BEHAVIOR
 What is the relationship between the various training programs and
 reform attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control?
 ",0.7848187239679962,80,8
880,"In summary:  (1) IPT-related training appears to have a positive effect
 on reform attitude and subjective norm and no significant effect on
 perceived behavioral control; (2) Road Show IV appears to have a
 positive effect on reform attitude, but no significant effect on subjec-
 tive norm or perceived behavioral control; and (3) acquisition train-
 ing appears to have largely insignificant effects on all three factors.",0.7547591739801053,80,8
881,"
 Given that attitude and subjective norm vary to some degree based
 on IPT training and Road Show IV participation, it will be useful to
 examine how underlying subfactors differ between those participat-
 ing in these two training programs and those not participating in
 these training programs. ",0.5715487682728028,80,8

 and Road Show IV training affect the outcome beliefs and outcome
 evaluations that underlie attitudes toward reform. ",0.9530471443936848,80,8

 believe that these eight—largely positive outcomes of reform—will
 result.",0.6882888596888931,81,3

 dustrial base, and improving cooperation with contractors.",1.114776556568053,81,0

 IPT Training Affects Subjective Norm Through Normative
 Beliefs and Motivation to Comply
 IPT training affects subjective norm toward reform through both
 normative beliefs and motivations to comply. ",0.5537863449131997,81,9

 IPT training is associated with statistically significant increases in the
 level of  NB   ×   MC  product for all three immediate referents:  supervi-
 sors, PMs, and co-workers. ",0.7356820498158367,81,8
898," In each case the increase in  NB   ×   MC
 product is the result of differences in normative beliefs between
 those with and without IPT training. ",0.7249938078708201,81,3
899," Those with IPT training had
 statistically significantly higher normative beliefs about immediate
 referents. ",0.4542976235393448,81,5

 products of the acquisition system.",0.454901159129387,81,7

 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEHAVIORAL DETERMINANTS
 According to the causal model used here, reform behavior—the

 norm, and perceived behavioral control. ",0.39636418222244596,85,3

 communication programs need to convince resistant elements that

 ability to meet work objectives; increase cooperation with contrac-
 tors; increase responsibilities; encourage commercial firms to do
 government work; make program management easier; and reduce
 program delays.",1.3901356529971278,93,8

 SUMMARY RECOMMENDATION:  USE AN IMPROVED ROAD
 SHOW TRAINING PROGRAM
 To summarize, the recommendations above call upon Army leader-
 ship to intensify their implementation and training efforts with
 respect to milspec and standard reform. ",1.2907790464885611,98,0
1113," Using the information gen-
 erated in this study, these recommendations advise Army leaders to
 “avoid preaching to the choir.” ",1.2128891346233044,98,1
1114," Focus implementation efforts on the
 elements of the work force exhibiting the greatest resistance to
 reform. ",0.908805980788246,98,0
1115," In large part, this effort can be conducted through existing
 training programs. ",0.6933433646000359,98,7
1116," IPT training has proved quite effective in chang-
 ing reform attitude and subjective norm. ",0.3342739240561532,98,6
1117," Road Show training has
 been effective in changing reform attitude. ",0.8589704255973416,98,1
1118," To be most effective,
 implementation and training efforts need to focus on not only the
 resistant elements of the work force but also the underlying sub-
 factors that characterize their individual resistance. ",0.9457237633199236,98,8
1119," Perhaps, under-
 lying subfactors can best be addressed through an improved and
 expanded Road Show training program. ",0.9997992924518816,98,0
1120," Such a program would build
 upon the suggestions above to improve the Road Show effect on
 normative beliefs and extend it to the subfactors important in
 determining subjective norm and perceived behavioral control.",0.8616071566938052,98,8
1121,"
 Although not stated explicitly in the analysis above, perhaps the best
 way to expand Road Show training, address resistant elements, and
 change their beliefs is through a decentralized and tailored Road
 Show program. ",1.0862622330885614,98,0
1122," While Road Show IV was conducted at major subor-
 dinate and buying commands, its focus was general and its atten-
 dance was limited. ",0.7820889640397202,98,1
1123," Given the fact that reform attitude, subjective
 norm, and perceived behavioral control vary largely by career group,
 experience level, and organization, it might be worthwhile to decen-
 tralize the Road Show program and tailor it to specific functional
 groups (engineering, QA, logistics) and/or programs (specific PEO
 programs or PM offices). ",0.8066665780644244,98,7
1124," In this manner, training programs can be
 tailored to local conditions and emphasis can be placed on immedi-
 ate referents. ",0.41865080983309383,98,6
1125," In addition, such a tailored program can provide
 training specific to local concerns and programs, providing more rel-
 evance to the training process. ",0.971759199249922,98,0
1126," This process should be viewed as
 88

 continual activity. ",0.7584167736366111,98,0
1127," Road Show training needs to be repeated, and
 there needs to be follow-up by relevant PMs and supervisors. ",0.8592362956394921,99,7
1128," A de-
 centralized training program—modeled on Road Show—that incor-
 porates the recommendations made above, coupled with an ongoing
 and expanded IPT training program, holds great promise for increas-
 ing reform attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral con-
 trol, thus influencing positively the adoption of the milspecs and
 standards policy by the acquisition work force.",0.9147699491963642,99,0
1129,"
 Finally, it is important to point out that these recommendations as-
 sume that the goal of Army leadership is the widespread adoption of
 milspec and standard reform by all employees. ",0.8324576225556872,99,0
1130," It may well be the
 case that Army leadership has determined that only specific groups
 need support the reform. ",0.9955916897685271,99,0
1131," If this is the case, the targets of training
 and implementation efforts may well be different groups. ",0.8231475635054214,99,8
1132," If, for ex-
 ample, Army leaders have determined that QA personnel are not
 essential to the successful application of this policy, they will not be
 targeted. ",0.7320599545386183,99,0
1133," However, the information provided in this study will assist
 in any targeting effort. ",0.727918956238506,99,7
1134," This study has determined the relative levels
 of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, reform in-
 tention, and reform behavior within the acquisition work force.",0.7535979592554437,99,8
1135,"
 Army leaders now have relative benchmarks upon which to judge the
 penetration of the policy into different career groups. ",0.5677939193235892,99,7
1136," Based on the
 overall reform strategy and goals of Army leadership, different target-
 ing schemes may be appropriate. ",0.9148684393871254,99,0
1137," If, however, the goal is acceptance
 of the policy across the work force, it may pay to target training and
 implementation efforts on QA, engineering, and logistics personnel
 in order to better align their underlying subfactors or beliefs.",1.092332873946383,99,0
1138,"
 In the end, the utility and relevance of this research lies in the value
 of the information provided to policymakers. ",0.6030948168442477,99,4
1139," The purpose of this
 study is to identify relationships and beliefs within the work force
 that when changed hold the promise of improving implementation
 of milspec and standard reform. ",1.0894072769778835,99,0
1140," Suggesting how the Army might
 adapt its current implementation efforts to better align the under-
 lying subfactors that contribute to reform attitude, subjective norm,

 about implementation strategies. ",1.0375767896316772,99,0

 Appendix
 ANALYTIC METHODS
 As outlined in Chapter Five, we conducted a comprehensive survey
 of Army acquisition personnel to provide a measurement of the vari-
 ous factors in the theory of planned behavior model. ",0.9951953083670223,100,4
1144," The survey was
 administered to a stratified random sample of 3,000 Army acquisi-
 tion employees; 1,774 responses were received (59 percent response
 rate). ",0.6041004401535076,101,4
1145," After “cleaning” the data by removing incomplete observations
 and those with indicator variable values in excess of three standard
 deviations from the mean, the analyzed sample had 1,653 observa-
 tions.",0.7576863426418593,101,5
1146,"
 SEM/LVM ANALYSIS
 To apply the theory of planned behavior to the data from the survey,
 we employed a form of causal modeling known as Structural Equa-
 tions Modeling (SEM)/Latent Variable Modeling (LVM). ",0.6915534365406082,101,5
1147," This
 method is characterized by Barbara Byrne:
 The term structural equation modeling conveys two important as-
 pects of the procedure:  (a) that the causal processes under study
 are represented by a series of structural (i.e., regression) equations,
 and (b) that these structural relations can be modeled pictorially to
 enable a clearer conceptualization of the theory under study. ",0.6771284069240103,101,5
1148," The
 hypothesized model can then be tested statistically in a simultane-
 ous analysis of the entire system of variables to determine the
 extent to which it is consistent with the data. ",0.816505411049083,101,5
1149," If goodness of fit is
 adequate, the model argues for the plausibility of postulated rela-
 tions among variables; if it is inadequate, the tenability of such rela-
 tions is rejected (Byrne, 1994, p. 3).",0.5496746461139603,101,5
1150,"

 Changing Bureaucratic Behavior:  Acquisition Reform in the U.S. Army
 Latent variables are unobservable. ",0.6461765088164898,101,6
1151," An example frequently used for a
 latent variable is intelligence. ",0.4903639825274604,102,5
1152," There are a variety of IQ tests, and
 these tests result in differing indicators of the latent variable:  intelli-
 gence. ",0.5948600050385711,102,5
1153," In SEM/LVM, multiple indicators of latent variables are used.",0.4984450639851044,102,5
1154,"
 Using multiple indicators has a distinct advantage over approaches
 that use a single indicator to represent each latent variable (such as
 path analysis). ",0.8728514007317729,102,5
1155," For example, the result of one IQ test is an indicator
 of intelligence. ",0.6552113764592139,102,7
1156," Using a single indicator requires the assumption that
 a variable has been measured perfectly (i.e., without error). ",0.8010360564349015,102,5
1157," Multiple
 indicators allow more reliability by identifying and taking into ac-
 count measurement error (Bentler, 1995; Bentler and Wu, 1995;
 Byrne, 1994; Pedhazur, 1982; Reinecke, Schmidt, and Ajzen, 1996).",0.7934679667885222,102,5
1158,"
 There are, therefore, two models in SEM/LVM analysis:  (1) the mea-
 surement model, which represents the relationship between indica-
 tor variables and the latent variables composing the model; and (2)
 the structural model, which represents the relations among the
 model’s latent variables (Bentler, 1995; Bentler and Wu, 1995; Byrne,
 1994). ",0.6142411779655149,102,5
1159, Figure A.1 shows the structural model. ,0.40224639244548865,102,5
1160," In it, attitude, subjec-
 tive norm, perceived behavioral control, reform intention, and re-
 form behavior are the latent variables. ",0.36559471990678993,102,3
1161," As with intelligence, these
 variables are unobservable, although there are various indicators of
 them. ",0.4431623312755624,102,5
1162," Any single indicator is related to a latent variable with error,
 and the use of multiple indicators allows this error to be identified
 and accounted for in model estimation. ",0.782952129817196,102,5
1163," This is accomplished in the
 measurement model.",0.7481472953312396,102,5
1164,"
 A measurement model represents the relationship between the
 model’s latent variables and some set of indicator variables. ",0.7737093964103701,102,5
1165," Specifi-
 cally, the measurement model postulates that the indicator variables
 are equal to some linear function of the latent variables plus an error
 term. ",0.6578746649485141,102,5
1166," This implies that the latent variable is a common factor ex-
 plaining the covariation among the indicator variables. ",0.4160084249929367,102,5
1167," The strength
 of the relationship between the indicator variables and the latent
 factor is measured by “factor loadings”—interpreted similarly to re-
 gression coefficients (Bentler, 1995; Byrne, 1994). ",0.5176138280375708,102,5
1168," The higher a given
 indicator variable’s factor loading, the better the internal consistency
 of the latent variable, and the better it is in explaining variation in the
 latent variable (Reinecke, Schmidt, and Ajzen, 1996).",0.6413553992904665,102,5

 form intention or reform behavior. ",0.6369526434233502,113,5

 without the hypothesized pathway between  PBC  and reform inten-

 variation in reform behavior. ",0.6933230809770532,113,5

 cent) and in reform behavior (35 percent). ",0.7796409163307088,113,5

 manage and operate within the defense acquisition system. ",0.7424953702526529,117,1
1311," The
 Army is currently encouraging the use of IPTs in the acquisition pro-

 various functions involved in the acquisition process to cooperate
 and “team.” ",0.9929181514664517,117,0
1312," Finally, the Army has instituted a series of Road Show
 training programs to advance its reform agenda. ",0.7268649779841921,117,2

 discontinue using milspecs and standards and how to rewrite them
 into performance-based specifications. ",0.9401049126066455,117,7

 and perceived behavioral control? ",0.6922105832388452,117,8
1316," In other words, is there significant
 variation in these factors as a function of these external variables?",0.4924123097775138,117,5

 These excluded groups are:
 •
 The effect of civilian career fields of engineering, quality assur-

 The effect of mid- or upper-grade civilian is relative to lower-
 grade civilian.",0.4726503051452399,118,6

 •
 The effect of the three training variables is relative to not having
 participated in the training programs.",0.6132915274882499,118,5

 These results show that several career groups are associated with
 lower values for attitude measures one and two, subjective norm,
 and perceived behavioral control measures one and two. ",0.7188653947963425,118,8

 the rank and grade-level groupings do not seem to be significantly
 associated with differences in the indicator variables. ",0.5542375584820213,118,5

 20 years’ experience is associated with a significant reduction in the
 level of both attitude measures. ",0.742442708392401,118,8

 ment (PM) is associated with significantly higher scores for the atti-
 tude and subjective norm measures.",0.7397510933774811,118,8

 Participation in acquisition training programs, most commonly De-
 fense Systems Management College (DSMC) or other Defense Ac-

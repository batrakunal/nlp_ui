 DoD should also formally identify its guiding coalition, recogniz-
 ing that acquisition program outcomes are influenced by stakeholders 
 outside the professional acquisition corps. ",0.7835721392684452,17,5
263,"That coalition should be 
 empowered and used as an embedding mechanism of cultural change: 
 deliberate role modeling, teaching, and coaching; allocation of rewards

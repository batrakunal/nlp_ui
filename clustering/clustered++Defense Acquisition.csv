 DEFENSE ACQUISITION
 Defense acquisition is a complex series of processes 
 a nation utilizes to obtain the goods and services 
 necessary to satisfy its defense needs. ",0.7107648645591365,1,1
1,"A nation’s 
 approach to defense acquisition is influenced by many 
 factors, including its history, politics, institutions, and 
 social and economic characteristics. ",0.6096735440400949,1,11
2,"While defense 
 acquisition is often challenging, the basic aims of a 
 defense acquisition system are shared throughout the 
 world: to deliver a quality product, on time, within budget, 
 that meets the requirements of the end user.",0.8912113425399776,1,6
3,"
 ",0.0,1,-1
4,"The process of deciding what to buy, how to buy, and how 
 to support the military systems and platforms needed to 
 execute roles and missions is very complex. ",0.8265497525022927,1,3
5,"Nations often 
 lack the systems, personnel, and funding to acquire and 
 sustain the appropriate defense systems and platforms. ",0.857308783345869,1,3
6,"
 An institutionalized set of processes that balances the 
 need for enhanced capabilities with the need to manage 
 limited resources and to ensure systems and platforms 
 are effectively sustained is vital. ",1.3245569299805322,1,9
7,"Defense acquisition 
 is the discipline that enables this balanced approach 
 through the combination of requirements analysis 
 and definition, planning, procurement, logistics, and 
 resource management.",1.1621695363855589,1,8
8,"
 ",0.0,1,-1
9,"The specific laws, regulations, policies, and procedures 
 that define a country’s approach to defense acquisition 
 can vary greatly according to many factors including 
 the structure of its government and armed forces, the 
 maturity of its defense sector, and scale of resourcing. ",0.9530855728301724,1,1
10,"
 When joining forces to advance shared interests, the U.S. 
 must have confidence that partner nations will be able to 
 plan, budget for and sustain capabilities over  
 the long term. ",0.9691063319569162,1,6
11,"Common challenges to meeting this 
 objective include:
   ♦
 Lack of established procedures to conduct 
 capability-based planning or requirements analysis 
 to determine prioritization of needed capabilities
   ♦
 Inability to translate capability requirements into a 
 clear and executable acquisition plan 
   ♦
 Insufficient budget allocation to operate and sustain 
 required systems and platforms or train personnel
   ♦
 Wasted and inefficient spending 
   ♦
 Lack of clear requirements or frequently changing 
 requirements

 The U.S. does not seek to replicate or impose its complex 
 acquisition system in partner nations. ",0.6779109820042813,1,7
15,"Partner nations 
 may face severe resource limitations and often have a 
 limited ability to develop new systems, instead relying 
 more heavily on existing technology and in many cases, 
 donor equipment. ",0.9601403796096091,2,6
16,"Accordingly, acquisition specialists work 
 closely with partner nation counterparts to evaluate the 
 overall defense acquisition system, identify vulnerabilities, 
 and address the most critical gaps. ",0.9773572562634405,2,0
17,"In many partner nations, 
 defense acquisition is interpreted narrowly as simply 
 procurement. ",0.33547191157472633,2,15
18,"Rigorous requirements analysis, capability 
 assessments, and resource analysis (including understanding 
 sustainment costs) may not be fully understood or

 that are often addressed when working with partner 
 nations include: 
 REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
   ♦
 What are the critical capability gaps that need to be 
 addressed through the procurement of new systems/
 platforms? ",1.1354792851865319,2,0
21,"What other materiel needs to be purchased 
 to sustain new systems/platforms?",0.8834093992352245,2,3
22,"
   ♦
 Have these capability gaps been assessed to determine 
 if there are viable alternatives to procurement (e.g. 
 DOTMLPF-P changes)? ",0.9545036109297905,2,6
23,"Is it clear how the new capability 
 will be integrated with existing capabilities and 
 institutions to create the desired outcome? ",0.7761460978554218,2,9
24,"
   ♦
 How are capabilities prioritized to ensure that limited 
 acquisition resources are directed to the most 
 important areas?",1.0957345201571496,2,9
25,"
 PROCUREMENT AND LOGISTICS
   ♦
 Do acquisition personnel have the necessary skills 
 and experience to negotiate and manage fair and 
 reasonable procurement contracts? ",0.8613251536590099,2,10
26,"
   ♦
 Do the necessary organizations (type, quantity, 
 location) and personnel (type, quantity, grade) exist to 
 employ and sustain the acquisition?
 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
   ♦
 Beyond the purchase price, how costly will this acquisition 
 be to own and operate over its anticipated life?
   ♦
 Are sufficient resources available to procure, deploy 
 and sustain the acquisition?
   ♦
 Is there funding in place to provide the acquisition 
 workforce with the education and training their jobs 
 require, and to retain qualified acquisition personnel? ",1.4217531867779485,2,10

 Does the budget appropriately account for the risk of 
 future cost growth?",0.9262228912035153,2,13

   ♦
 Poorly trained acquisition and logistics workforce with 
 frequent turnover as experienced personnel leave 
 government service for higher paying jobs in the  
 private sector
   ♦
 High value transactions and a frequent lack of 
 transparency make defense acquisition especially 
 vulnerable to fraud and corruption 
   ♦
 Negotiators may lack the skills and experience 
 to negotiate complex agreements with industry 
 representatives who are highly trained in their field 
   ♦
 Laws or policies may require acquisition of lowest 
 price option in many cases, often at the expense of 
 capability and sustainability
 These challenges can combine to leave nations financially 
 strained and operationally limited, leading to a wide range 
 of problems and making them significantly less capable 
 of meeting their own defense needs, and of serving as an 
 effective, trusted U.S. security partner.",1.284591271569596,2,4

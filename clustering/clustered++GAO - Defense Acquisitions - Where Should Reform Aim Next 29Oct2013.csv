 Where Should Reform Aim Next? ",0.5807204794661062,2,9

 Why GAO Did This Study 
 DOD’s acquisition of major weapon 
 systems has been on GAO’s high risk 
 list since 1990. ",0.7351820891290268,2,6
5,"Over the past 50 years, 
 Congress and DOD have continually 
 explored ways to improve acquisition 
 outcomes, including reforms that have 
 championed sound management 
 practices, such as realistic cost 
 estimating, prototyping, and systems 
 engineering. ",1.136677689246978,2,6
6,"Too often, GAO reports 
 on the same kinds of problems today 
 that it did over 20 years ago. ",0.5336708366610281,2,10
7," 
 The topic of today’s hearing is: “25 
 Years of Acquisition Reform: Where 
 Do We Go From Here?” ",0.5766206658556451,2,9
8," To that end, 
 this testimony discusses (1) the 
 performance of DOD’s major defense 
 acquisition program portfolio; (2) the 
 management policies and processes 
 currently in place to guide those 
 acquisitions; (3) the incentives to 
 deviate from otherwise sound 
 acquisition practices; and (4) 
 suggestions to temper these 
 incentives. ",0.9208130398061787,2,6
9,"This statement draws from 
 GAO’s extensive body of work on 
 DOD’s acquisition of weapon systems. ",0.5228429666910476,2,9
10,"
  
 What GAO Found 
 The Department of Defense (DOD) must get better outcomes from its weapon 
 system investments, which in recent years have totaled around $1.5 trillion or 
 more. ",0.6999908282212042,2,9
11,"Recently, there have been some improvements, owing in part to reforms. ",0.8642935107617934,2,10
12,"
 For example, cost growth declined between 2011 and 2012 and a number of 
 programs also improved their buying power by finding efficiencies in 
 development or production and requirements changes. ",0.9944089548445825,2,1
13,"Still, cost and schedule 
 growth remain significant; 39 percent of fiscal 2012 programs have had unit cost 
 growth of 25 percent or more. ",0.9347118572355786,2,1
14," 
 DOD’s acquisition policy provides a methodological framework for developers to 
 gather knowledge that confirms that their technologies are mature, their designs 
 stable, and their production processes are in control. ",0.7765742338976909,2,6
15,"The Weapon Systems 
 Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 and DOD’s recent “Better Buying Power” 
 initiatives introduced significant changes that, when fully implemented, should 
 further strengthen practices that can lead to successful acquisitions. ",1.119369075163824,2,6
16,"GAO has 
 also made numerous recommendations to improve the acquisition process, 
 based on its extensive work in the area. ",0.9608502826655659,2,6
17,"While recent reforms have benefited 
 individual programs, it is premature to say there is a trend or a corner has been 
 turned. ",0.6049509515793793,2,10
18,"The reforms still face implementation challenges and have not yet been 
 institutionalized within the services. ",1.0218137758189267,2,9
19," 
 Reforms that focus on the methodological procedures of the acquisition process 
 are only partial remedies because they do not address incentives to deviate from 
 sound practices. ",0.9762885321286546,2,8
20,"Weapons acquisition is a complicated enterprise, complete with 
 unintended incentives that encourage moving programs forward by delaying 
 testing and employing other problematic practices. ",0.8523028945701807,2,8
21,"These incentives stem from 
 several factors. ",0.483166920120013,2,2
22,"For example, the different participants in the acquisition process 
 impose conflicting demands on weapon programs so that their purpose 
 transcends just filling voids in military capability. ",0.6861763820658595,2,6
23,"Also, the budget process forces 
 funding decisions to be made well in advance of program decisions, which 
 encourages undue optimism about program risks and costs. ",1.132073136097211,2,5
24,"Finally, DOD 
 program managers’ short tenures and limitations in experience and training can 
 foster a short-term focus and put them at a disadvantage with their industry 
 counterparts. ",0.9802569565304787,2,8
25," 
 Drawing on its extensive body of work in weapon systems acquisition, GAO sees 
 several areas of focus regarding where to go from here:   
 •  
 at the start of new programs, using funding decisions to reinforce desirable 
 principles such as well-informed acquisition strategies;  
 •  
 identifying significant risks up front and resourcing them; 
 •  
 exploring ways to align budget decisions and program decisions more 
 closely; and 
 •  
 attracting, training, and retaining acquisition staff and managers so that they 
 are both empowered and accountable for program outcomes. ",1.309124519142227,2,6
26," 
 These areas are not intended to be all-encompassing, but rather, practical places 
 to start the hard work of realigning incentives with desired results. ",0.7643058458038132,2,7

 systemic improvements to the acquisition process. ",0.8794604323396662,3,6
33,"The work on which 
 this testimony is based was conducted in accordance with generally 
 accepted government auditing standards. ",0.7329463794773631,3,2

 management practices, such as realistic cost estimating, prototyping, and 
 systems engineering. ",0.9628998639365054,3,6

 sequestration have lent additional impetus to reduce the costs of 
 weapons. ",0.9462433503779343,3,1

 report on the same kinds of problems today that we did over 20 years 
 ago. ",0.5799315295021832,3,10
40,"The cost growth of DOD’s 2012 portfolio of weapon systems about 
 $411 billion and schedule delays average more than 2 years. ",0.8909800708964176,3,1

 better results the focus should not be on adding to or discarding 
 acquisition policies, but on the incentives that work against them. ",0.9282686677219629,3,8

 The fact that programs adopt practices that run counter to what policy and 
 reform call for is evidence of the other pressures and incentives that 
 significantly influence program practices and outcomes. ",0.8386110914623593,8,8

 next. ",0.16492083769616325,9,11

 An oft-cited quote of David Packard, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, 
 is: “We all know what needs to be done. ",0.5864422427398873,9,9
102,"The question is why aren’t we 
 doing it?” ",0.36063324644377376,9,11

 versus the “why.” ",0.5726664144222073,9,10
104,"They have championed sound management practices, 
 such as realistic estimating, thorough testing, and accurate reporting. ",0.8104301118535264,9,5
105,"
 Today, these practices are well known. ",0.41563008835682824,9,12
106,"We need to consider that they 
 mainly address the mechanisms of weapon acquisitions. ",0.8841221170387821,9,6
107,"Seen this way, 
 the practices prescribed in policy are only partial remedies. ",0.5498759464469478,9,2
108,"The 
 acquisition of weapons is much more complex than policy describes and 
 involves very basic and strongly reinforced incentives to field weapons. ",0.7438292875326525,9,8
109,"
 Accordingly, rival practices, not normally viewed as good management 
 techniques, comprise an effective stratagem for fielding a weapon 
 because they reduce the risk that the program will be interrupted or called 
 into question. ",0.8589130801143217,9,6
110,"
 I will now discuss several factors that illustrate the pressures that create 
 incentives to deviate from sound acquisition management practices. ",0.7035388338673616,9,8
111,"
  
  
  
  
 The process of acquiring new weapons is (1) shaped by its different 
 participants and (2) far more complex than the seemingly straightforward 
 purchase of equipment to defeat an enemy threat. ",0.6100295057435321,9,11
112,"Collectively, as 
 participants’ needs are translated into actions on weapon programs, the 
 purpose of such programs transcends efficiently filling voids in military 
 capability. ",0.7923499285175761,9,6
113,"Weapons have become integral to policy decisions, definitions 
 of roles and functions, justifications of budget levels and shares, service 
 reputations, influence of oversight organizations, defense spending in 
 localities, the industrial base, and individual careers. ",0.9116542543271071,9,12
114,"Thus, the reasons 
 “why” a weapon acquisition program is started are manifold and 
 acquisitions do not merely provide technical solutions. ",0.7065127063410422,9,6

 While individual participants see their needs as rational and aligned with 
 the national interest, collectively, these needs create incentives for 
 pushing programs and encouraging undue optimism, parochialism, and 
 other compromises of good judgment. ",0.8500326002894132,9,8
116,"Under these circumstances, 
 persistent performance problems, cost growth, schedule slippage, and 
 difficulties with production and field support cannot all be attributed to 
 errors, lack of expertise, or unforeseeable events. ",1.0179750548329385,10,1
117,"Rather, a level of these 
 problems is embedded as the undesirable, but apparently acceptable, 
 consequence of the process. ",0.5925492780154061,10,11
118,"These problems persist not because they 
 are overlooked or under-regulated, but because they enable more 
 programs to survive and thus more needs to be met. ",0.675878578723596,10,7
119,"The problems are 
 not the fault of any single participant; they are the collective responsibility 
 of all participants. ",0.4871928630620459,10,11
120,"Thus, the various pressures that accompany the 
 reasons why a program is started can also affect and compromise the 
 practices employed in its acquisition. ",0.601289395875078,10,8
121,"
 I would like to highlight three characteristics about program funding that 
 create incentives in decision making that can run counter to sound 
 acquisition practices. ",0.914869570998315,10,8
122,"First, there is an important difference between what 
 investments in new products represent for a private firm and for DOD. ",0.6279956722493605,10,12
123,"In 
 a private firm, a decision to invest in a new product, like a new car design, 
 represents an expense. ",0.6703228830910963,10,11
124,"Company funds must be expended that will not 
 provide a revenue return until the product is developed, produced, and 
 sold. ",0.8835704301755106,10,11
125,"In DOD, new products, in the form of budget line items, can 
 represent revenue. ",0.6792600223624549,10,1
126,"An agency may be able to justify a larger budget if it 
 can win approval for more programs. ",0.7029239720875626,10,5
127,"Thus, weapon system programs can 
 be viewed both as expenditures and revenue generators. ",0.5184143932713711,10,1
128,"
 Second, budgets to support major program commitments must be 
 approved well ahead of when the information needed to support the 
 decision to commit is available. ",0.83981061392252,10,5
129,"Take, for example, a decision to start a 
 new program scheduled for August 2016. ",0.7715138488900304,10,5
130,"Funding for that decision would 
 have to be included in the fiscal year 2016 budget. ",1.0619055067718757,10,1
131,"This budget would be 
 submitted to Congress in February 2015—18 months before the program 
 decision review is actually held. ",0.8835948235708014,10,5
132,"DOD would have committed to the 
 funding before the budget request went to Congress. ",1.0122144190787106,10,10
133,"It is likely that the 
 requirements, technologies, and cost estimates for the new program—
 essential to successful execution—may not be very solid at the time of 
 funding approval. ",1.1468796669978767,10,6
134,"Once the hard-fought budget debates put money on the 
 table for a program, it is very hard to take it away later, when the actual 
 program decision point is reached. ",0.7471239260699879,10,11
135,"

 Third, to the extent a program wins funding, the principles and practices it 
 embodies are thus endorsed. ",0.6709181215833607,10,8
136,"So, if a program is funded despite having 
 an unrealistic schedule or requirements, that decision reinforces those 
 characteristics, not sound acquisition processes. ",0.9333280318541156,11,6
137,"Pressure to make 
 exceptions for programs that do not measure up are rationalized in a 
 number of ways: an urgent threat needs to be met; a production capability 
 needs to be preserved; despite shortfalls, the new system is more 
 capable than the one it is replacing; or the new system’s problems will be 
 fixed in the future. ",1.1346463783111602,11,7
138,"It is the funding approvals that ultimately define 
 acquisition policy. ",0.9347021897984376,11,5
139,"
 DOD has a unique relationship with the defense industry that differs from 
 the commercial marketplace. ",0.4385163097006564,11,12
140,"The combination of a single buyer (DOD), a 
 few very large prime contractors in each segment of the industry, and a 
 limited number of weapon programs constitutes a structure for doing 
 business that is altogether different from a classic free market. ",0.8243992619917768,11,12
141,"For 
 instance, there is less competition, more regulation, and once a contract 
 is awarded, the contractor has considerable power. ",0.6142524804686614,11,11
142,"10  Moreover, in the 
 defense marketplace, the firm and the customer have jointly developed 
 the product and, as we have reported previously, the closer the product 
 comes to production the more the customer becomes invested and the 
 less likely they are to walk away from that investment. ",0.7502185179402943,11,7
143,"11
 J. Ronald Fox, author of  Defense Acquisition Reform 1960-2009: An 
 Elusive Goal , sums up the situation as follows. ",0.6348449754428508,11,9
144,"“Many defense acquisition 
 problems are rooted in the mistaken belief that the defense industry and 
 the government-industry relationship in defense acquisition fit naturally 
 into the free enterprise model. ",0.5502984897150531,11,12
145,"Most Americans believe that the defense 
 industry, as a part of private industry, is equipped to handle any kind of 
 development or production program. ",0.6116647375252726,11,12

  While a defense 
 firm and a military customer may share some of the same goals, 
 important goals are different. ",0.6018301517154337,11,12

 shareholders and can also build constituencies outside the direct 
 business relationship between them and their customers. ",0.7121949027047377,11,12

 large defense programs are developed and produced through the free 
 enterprise system.” ",0.6718536500212297,12,12

 Dr. Fox also points out that in private industry, the program manager 
 concept works well because the managers have genuine decision-making 
 authority, years of training and experience, and understand the roles and 
 tactics within government and industry. ",0.9133599233114156,12,0

 In my more than 30 years in the area, I do not know of a time or era when 
 weapon system programs did not exhibit the same symptoms that they do

 At this point, we should build on existing reforms—not necessarily by 
 revisiting the process itself but by augmenting it by tackling incentives. ",0.7929123266244978,13,8

 do this, we need to look differently at the familiar outcomes of weapon 
 systems acquisition—such as cost growth, schedule delays, large support 
 burdens, and reduced buying power. ",0.9931283372530714,13,6

 outcomes are clearly due to honest mistakes and unforeseen obstacles. ",0.4896248058475349,13,11

 sufficient to define the problem as an objective process that is broken. ",0.7731853313419024,13,7

 Rather, it is more accurate to view the problem as a sophisticated 
 process whose consistent results are indicative of its being in equilibrium. ",0.6556053777147104,13,7

 cost growth and schedule delays suggests that these are consequences 
 that participants in the process have been willing to accept. ",0.9054122314061372,13,7

 Drawing on our extensive body of work in weapon systems acquisition, I 
 have four areas of focus regarding where to go from here. ",0.6609206850081141,13,2

 and practices programs embrace are determined not by policy, but by 
 decisions. ",0.6999930678084457,13,8

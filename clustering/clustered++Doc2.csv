 As set forth by statute and regulation, from concept to deployment, a weapon system must go 
 through a three-step process of identifying a required (needed) weapon system, establishing a 
 budget, and acquiring the system. ",1.2278249965408603,2,5

 At each milestone, a program must meet specific statutory and regulatory requirements before the 
 program can proceed to the next phase of the acquisition process. ",0.7611861369179548,2,5

 Both Congress and DOD have been active in trying to improve defense acquisitions. ",0.7276155688516753,2,8
16,"A 
 comprehensive legislative effort to improve weapon system acquisition occurred in May 2009, 
 when Congress passed and the President signed into law the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform 
 Act of 2009 (S. 454/P.L. 111-23). ",0.9793181912612472,2,4

 Introduction 
 ",0.566104500929504,3,4
30,"This report provides an overview of the process by which the Department of Defense (DOD) 
 acquires weapon systems and briefly discusses recent major efforts by Congress and DOD to 
 improve the performance of the acquisition system. ",1.0019753436277137,4,8

 Background 
 The Department of Defense acquires goods and services from contractors, federal arsenals, and 
 shipyards to support military operations. ",0.5974162901476833,4,4
33," Acquisition  is a broad term that applies to more than just 
 the purchase of an item or service; the acquisition process encompasses the design, engineering, 
 construction, testing, deployment, sustainment, and disposal of weapons or related items 
 purchased from a contractor. ",0.9404657990495023,4,3
34,"1  From a policy perspective, federal regulations and federal law 
 generally use the terms  acquisition  and  procurement  interchangeably. ",0.8269669134153471,4,4
35,"2  The term procurement, 
 when used within the context of acquisitions, is different from the budget definition of 
 procurement that generally references the Procurement budget appropriations account—a funding 
 stream that is distinct from Research and Development, Operations and Maintenance, and other 
 budget categories. ",1.0275810239953866,4,3
36,"
 DOD’s acquisition process is highly complex and does not always produce systems that meet 
 estimated cost or performance expectations. ",0.95125514332778,4,11
37,"Congress has been concerned with the structure and 
 performance of the defense acquisition system for many years. ",0.7405893057787594,4,8
38,"For example, the House Armed 
 Services Committee’s report of the FY2007 defense authorization bill stated 
 Simply put, the Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition process is broken. ",0.6426557702362719,4,4
39,"The ability of 
 the Department to conduct the large scale acquisitions required to ensure our future national 
 security is a concern of the committee. ",0.8240987732970486,4,11
40,"The rising costs and lengthening schedules of major 
 defense acquisition programs lead to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. ",0.8556592377055059,4,10
41,"
 The committee’s concerns extend to all three key components of the Acquisition process 
 including requirements generation, acquisition and contracting, and financial management. ",0.8052182930413317,4,5

 Over the decades, congressional oversight has focused on many aspects of the acquisition 
 process, from “micro-level” practices, such as characteristics of a particular contract, to “macro-
 level” practices, such as management and execution of the Joint Strike Fighter and other Major 
 Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). ",0.8288153526931092,4,8
52,"4  Congress has held oversight hearings and enacted 
 legislation in an effort to improve the defense acquisition structure and its practices. ",0.9177262320194108,5,8
53,"5   
 Statutory and Regulatory Foundation 
 Title 10 of the  United States Code  governs the organization, structure, and operation of the Armed 
 Forces of the United States. ",0.7212159860151879,5,4
54,"Several sections within the title charge the secretaries of the military 
 departments (Army, Navy, and Air Force) with responsibility to “equip” the armed forces. ",0.5797661277143762,5,4
55,"
 General procurement provisions, many of which apply to MDAPs and MAISs (Major Automated 
 Information Systems), are spread throughout the title, including assignment of responsibilities, 
 establishment of acquisition procedures, and requirements for reporting to Congress. ",0.9309173566211544,5,9
56,"The annual 
 National Defense Authorization Acts are one of the principal mechanisms by which Congress 
 modifies the defense acquisition structure, also set forth in Title 10. ",0.7724045708040472,5,4
57,"
 DOD procurement activities are generally governed by three sets of federal government 
 regulations:  
 •  
  The first set of regulations applies to the entire federal government (including 
 DOD unless stated otherwise) and is found in the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
 (FAR). ",1.010583221779631,5,3
58," 
 •  
 The second set of regulations applies only to DOD and is found in the Defense 
 Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. ",0.7651222356301915,5,4
59," 
 •  
 The third set of regulations applies only to individual DOD components and is 
 found in component-unique FAR Supplements. ",0.7019896175264935,5,3
60,"6   
 Procurement actions in DOD must adhere to the various regulations, and program managers must 
 take the regulations into account during the planning and execution of their programs. ",1.0849925178087916,5,5
61,"
 The Process for Buying a Weapon System 
 Every weapon system in the U.S. arsenal is intended to satisfy a specific military need (often 
 referred to as a  requirement) , must be paid for by the federal  budget , and is designed and built 
 within an  acquisition system . ",1.0208121122506868,5,11
62,"From concept to deployment, a weapon system must go through the 
                                                                  
 4  MDAPs are the Department’s most expensive acquisition programs. ",0.5957694506499057,5,5
63,"MDAPs are statutorily defined in 10 U.S.C. 
 §2430 as DOD acquisition programs whose value based on FY1990 constant dollars exceeds $300 million of Research, 
 Development, Test and Evaluation funding (approximately $442 million in FY2009 dollars), $1.8 billion of 
 Procurement funding (approximately $2.578 billion in FY2009 dollars), or are designated MDAPs by the Under 
 Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. ",1.0537178798956994,5,5
64,"
 5  Congress’s authority to reorganize the defense acquisition process stems primarily from Article I, Section 8, of the 
 Constitution, which vests the legislature with the power to “raise and support Armies ... provide and maintain a Navy ... ",0.7987917237673677,5,4
65,"
 [and] make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.” ",0.6729604410026291,5,1

 the system. ",1.0173306165962108,5,8

 The Requirements Process: Joint Capabilities Integration and 
 Development System (JCIDS)  
 The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System is the process by which DOD 
 identifies, assesses, and prioritizes what capabilities the military requires to fulfill its mission. ",1.0549478912448527,6,2
78,"As 
 such, JCIDS is often referred to as the requirements generation process. ",0.5727393788397112,6,2
79,"Requirements identified 
 through JCIDS can be addressed in a number of ways, including changes in doctrine, training, 
 and organization, or the acquisition of a new item, such as a weapon system. ",1.051171497304558,6,2
80," 
 The JCIDS process was created in 2003 in an effort to fundamentally change the way DOD 
 developed requirements. ",0.9411389194119074,6,2
81,"Prior to 2003, DOD used a threat-based approach to identifying 
 warfighter requirements. ",0.8903940436212753,6,2
82,"7  With the advent of JCIDS, DOD shifted to a capabilities-based 
 approach to identifying warfighter needs. ",0.8846058513269349,6,2

 fielding systems based on specific perceived threats to the nation, DOD adopted a policy of 
 identifying what capabilities it needs to meet the strategic direction and priorities set forth in 
 high-level strategy and guidance documents such as the National Military Strategy, National 
 Defense Strategy, and Quadrennial Defense Review. 8   
 Many analysts suggest that under the threat-based approach, each military service identified a 
 threat, and in response to the threat developed its own independent weapons. ",1.2921876643163472,6,11
85,"The shift to a 
 capabilities-based approach served to promote a more collaborative method of identifying 
 capability gaps across services instead of each service developing its own response. ",0.9630398620449234,7,11
86,"As a result, 
 weapon systems are expected to be developed jointly among services. ",0.6885431516492879,7,11
87," 
 JCIDS is governed by the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction   (CJCSI) 3170.01H  
 and utilizes the procedures described in the  Manual for the Operation of the Joint Capabilities 
 Integration and Development System . ",0.8889273193734256,7,2
88,"  According to DOD policy, the first step in the process is to 
 conduct a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA), which analyzes the military’s capability needs 
 and gaps, and recommends both materiel 9  and non-materiel ways to address the gaps. ",1.352689469352958,7,2
89,"10  If, as a 
 result of a CBA or a comparable study a materiel solution (such as a weapon system) is 
 considered, an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) is prepared. ",1.0517358017901512,7,7
90,"11  The ICD justifies the need for a 
 materiel solution to satisfy the identified capability gap. ",0.8103111239692347,7,7
91," 
 The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), the organization responsible for identifying 
 and prioritizing warfighter requirements, must approve the ICD. ",0.9452575045741717,7,2
92,"12  To approve the ICD, the JROC 
 reviews and validates  
 •  
 the capabilities required to perform the defined mission, 
 •  
 the gap in capabilities required to perform the mission, and  
 •  
 how the identified capability gap will be addressed (in whole or in part). ",1.2224687150500597,7,2
93,"
 The JROC may approve an ICD and recommend a non-materiel solution to meeting the military 
 need, such as a change to strategy or tactics. ",1.0014963980098326,7,2

 program enters the Defense Acquisition System (“little ‘a’”). ",0.5793518313268459,7,5

 In today’s defense environment, pressure is growing on policymakers 
 to make the defense acquisition system more nimble and eff ective. ",0.5971255540262643,4,5
35,"To 
 help, prior to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the RAND Corpo-
 ration was asked to prepare a series of white papers as part of the Offi  ce 
 of the Secretary of Defense’s eff ort to provide the next administration 
 with guidance on defense acquisition challenges in several areas likely 
 to be of critical importance to the new defense acquisition leadership: 
 competition, risk management, novel systems, prototyping, organiza-
 tional and management issues, and the acquisition workforce. ",1.034052701513891,5,0

 Summary
 Despite years of change and reform, the Department of Defense (DoD) 
 continues to develop and acquire weapon systems that it cannot aff ord 
 and cannot deliver on schedule. ",1.1180253330134047,13,4
68,"Consequently, defense acquisition 
 is one of the most urgent issues that DoD has to address today—a 
 point emphatically conveyed by Deputy Secretary of Defense William 
 Lynn during his confi rmation hearing: “[A]cquisition reform is not an 
 option, it is an imperative” (2009, p. 10).",0.7978123511670903,15,5
69,"
 Th is monograph is designed to inform new initiatives for mark-
 edly improving the cost, timeliness, and innovativeness of weapon sys-
 tems that DoD intends to acquire. ",0.8157286588832896,15,0
70,"It is the result of a RAND eff ort 
 that led to six occasional papers on topics that are likely to be of critical 
 importance to DoD leadership: competition, novel systems, prototyp-
 ing, risk management, organizational and management issues, and the 
 acquisition workforce. ",0.9514645479209253,15,0
71,"Th ese papers build on RAND staff ’s deep expe-
 rience in acquisition management issues to provide innovative ideas 
 and suggestions to revitalize defense acquisitions.",0.8930499407726942,15,5
72,"
 Findings
 Savings from Competition Are Not Inevitable
 Th e value of competition is so much taken for granted that defense 
 offi  cials are often criticized for not relying more frequently on com-
 petition in awarding contracts for major defense systems. ",0.6992245093187419,15,0
73,"However, 
 a second production source does not guarantee savings in every pro-
 curement. ",0.5021866945051878,15,3

 level of market uncertainty. ",0.5615105094087801,15,3
75,"Moreover, competition requires additional 
 time, money, and management eff ort.",0.8182525187511438,16,3
76,"
 RAND researchers used historical data and a RAND-developed 
 methodology to determine whether and when competition is a rea-
 sonable acquisition strategy during the production phase. ",0.8926297152357181,16,4
77,"Th e analysis 
 indicates that competition is more reasonable in situations in which 
 nonrecurring costs are low, cost improvement is minimal, and a greater 
 number of units will be produced. ",1.0677692782095942,16,3
78,"In some cases—especially in the 
 procurement of major systems whose nonrecurring costs are large—it 
 may actually be less costly for the government to forgo competition.",0.8695568256580256,16,3
79,"
 DoD Must Accept More Risk to Meet Demand for Novel Systems
 Today, there is a growing need to respond to asymmetrical threats using 
 novel weapon systems that can be quickly developed and fi elded. ",0.8378380389574084,16,4
80,"Novel 
 systems—such as the F-117 Stealth Fighter and robotic ground vehi-
 cles—involve more uncertainty than conventional systems, not only 
 with regard to design and technology but also in terms of how they 
 will be used, how many units will be needed, and how much they will 
 cost (see Table S.1).",0.8943772321678641,16,4
81,"
 Current acquisition policies and processes are too risk averse to 
 enable the eff ective development and timely employment of novel sys-
 tems. ",0.6111355010402052,16,4
82,"Consequently, DoD needs a separate acquisition strategy that

83,"Th e new strategy should include a focus on unique integrations 
 of existing and emerging technologies, a willingness to accept risks, 
 easy and quick termination of programs not yielding expected benefi ts, 
 and early test and demonstration of military utility.",0.9374880711081015,17,4
84,"
 Oversight Is Based on Dollar Value, Irrespective of Risk
 DoD assigns responsibility for decisions on major defense acquisi-
 tion programs on the basis of the program’s dollar value. ",0.8084352686557161,17,4
85,"Th e higher 
 the value, the more senior the decisionmaker. ",0.5519729460716476,17,1
86,"Th is approach has been 
 constantly refi ned over the years without having noticeably improved 
 acquisition outcomes. ",0.628787139174303,17,0
87,"A new paradigm in which the level of over-
 sight and management would be based on the level of risk a program 
 represents would help DoD more eff ectively manage weapon system 
 programs. ",0.7836456984537826,17,4
88,"Some very costly projects might have signifi cantly less risk 
 than projects of similar cost and thus should require less oversight. ",1.150746486681285,17,3
89,"
 Conversely, projects may cost little but have a lot of risk because they 
 push the state of the art in technology; such programs require more-

 Organizational Schisms and Rigid Processes 
 Contribute to Inefﬁ ciencies
 Many of the problems that contribute to poor cost and schedule out-
 comes are systemic to the way that the acquisition process is organized 
 and managed in DoD. Specifi cally, organizational schisms and overly 
 prescribed management processes contribute both to ineffi  ciencies in 
 the acquisition system and to unrealistic expectations.",0.9584180459132153,18,4
103,"
 For example, service chiefs 1 —who validate warfi ghting require-
 ments—have become increasingly disconnected from the service acqui-
 sition executives who develop and acquire new weapon and information 
 systems in conjunction with their program executive offi  cers and pro-
 gram managers. ",0.8256681294992779,18,4
104,"Without suffi  cient dialogue between these entities, ser-
 vice chiefs may emphasize warfi ghting needs at the expense of reducing

 Evidence of the Beneﬁ ts of Prototyping Is Mixed
 Acquisition policy and practice refl ect the recurring theme that pro-
 totyping as part of weapon system development can reduce cost and 
 time; allow demonstration of novel system concepts; provide a basis for 
 competition; validate cost estimates, design, and manufacturing pro-
 cesses; and reduce or mitigate technical risk. ",1.0627770588549805,19,4

 of RAND research on prototyping indicates that the available evidence 
 on its benefi ts is somewhat mixed overall. ",0.6371013633714585,19,0

 record does reveal some of the conditions under which prototyping 
 strategies seem most likely to yield benefi ts in a development program. ",0.6742951555351575,19,4

 maker with mixed results, so, in essence, DoD’s new competitive pro-

 CHAPTER ONE
 Determining When Competition Is a 
 Reasonable Strategy for the Production 
 Phase of Defense Acquisition
 Mark V. Arena and John Birkler
 Introduction
 Th e use of competition in weapon system acquisition is widely advo-
 cated in policy statements and widely refl ected in requirements issued 
 by Congress, the Offi  ce of Management and 
 Budget (OMB), the Department of Defense 
 (DoD), and the military services. ",1.599219110684221,21,5
142,"Th is empha-
 sis stems from the conviction that competition 
 during the production phase of the acquisition 
 system will drive the unit cost of a system or 
 subsystem down and reduce overall procure-
 ment cost to the government. ",0.8538029150636011,27,3
143,"1  Other argu-
 ments for having more than one producer exist 
 (e.g., providing a surge capability should the 
 services need to expand production quickly), but the crux of the com-
 petition issue is procurement cost (or, more accurately, price).",1.1174207206305473,27,3
144,"
 We do not question the value of competition as a means of induc-
 ing a fi rm to reduce prices, but it is not self-evident that a second 
 production source will produce savings for the government in every 
 procurement. ",0.8118884191781622,27,3
145,"In some cases—especially in the procurement of major 
 systems where the nonrecurring costs are large—it may actually be less 
 1  A variety of competitive strategies exist. ",0.7618765748189816,27,3
146,"Each strategy addresses particular features of major 
 acquisitions and is applicable to diff erent phases of the acquisition process. ",0.7167764916977969,27,4
147,"Th e focus of this 
 analysis is on saving money during the production phase. ",0.8403377494246166,27,3

 Senior DoD offi  cials must determine whether competition is likely 
 to result in savings or losses for the government. ",0.6947408580838821,28,3
151,"Th is paper compares the 
 characteristics of a typical business market to those of defense acquisi-
 tions, identifi es the benefi ts and drawbacks of competition in defense 
 acquisitions specifi cally, and shows how to determine when the introduc-
 tion of competition during production is a  reasonable  acquisition strategy.",0.6723845832867104,28,4

 Pentagon Acquisitions: Not Business As Usual
 Th e complexity and uniqueness of major defense procurement make 
 it diffi  cult for DoD to follow typical commercial business price-
 competition approaches. ",0.832561154538554,28,0
153,"In the typical business market, a buyer exam-
 ines the available products, requests competitive bids for production 
 from a number of contractors, selects a bid based on a fi xed price, 
 and signs a one-step contract for delivery on a 
 specifi ed date. ",0.9269905360940821,28,3
154,"Such a market depends on hav-
 ing complete information about a customer’s 
 needs; a standardized, off -the-shelf product; a 
 predictable budget; certainty about the num-
 ber of items to be purchased; and little reason 
 for concern about the future viability of the 
 losing fi rm. ",0.8571310747142051,28,3
155,"Major defense acquisitions lack 
 these characteristics.",0.4185996079998488,28,0
156,"
 In major defense acquisitions, the rela-
 tionship between buyer and producer is almost 
 completely diff erent from that assumed in the 
 economist’s model of the typical business market. ",0.5445220890611818,28,3
157,"For example, defense 
 acquisitions have only one domestic buyer; producers typically compete 
 during the design stage as opposed to the production stage; and concern 
 about sustaining a unique industrial sector factors into the buyer’s deci-
 sionmaking process. ",0.7506849698091739,28,4

 the typical business market (or “perfect market”) and compares them to

 As indicated in the table, quality and schedule are often more 
 important criteria than price in defense acquisitions. ",1.0703384588724567,29,3
161,"Th e high prior-
 ity the defense buyer usually gives to product quality is sometimes 
 regarded as a defect in the acquisition process. ",0.7107707156470437,29,3
162,"Th e conventional wis-
 dom is that when programs experience diffi  culties, expenditure is the 
 fi rst constraint to be relaxed and schedule the second, but that perfor-
 mance goals are adhered to quite rigorously, with the result that the 
 unit price of the product increases.",0.9766210891851879,29,3
163,"
 Th e data support this description of the way quality, schedule, 
 and price are traded off , but it is by no means clear that this should 
 be accepted as adverse criticism. ",0.9998353497327785,29,3
164,"Th e Services’ emphasis on high sys-
 tem quality is consistent with the long-established national policy that 
 emphasizes quality rather than quantity for defense, and hence calls for 
 the development and production of systems superior to those fi elded 
 by possible opponents. ",0.8894429241701038,29,4
165,"If this emphasis is accepted, the question is not 
 so much whether quality should be given priority, but rather, what 
 kind of quality and how much quality is enough? ",0.765686615476523,29,0

 of product that requires innovations in design and the application of 
 advanced technologies, with all the technical uncertainty this entails.",0.8568312777260005,29,4

 Comparison of the typical business market and defense acquisi-
 tions helps illustrate the inherent diffi  culties in introducing eff ective 
 price competition into defense acquisitions. ",0.6371045989962064,29,3

 To illustrate the potential range of answers with the RCR meth-
 odology, we built a simple spreadsheet model to evaluate competition 
 using diff erent key assumptions. ",0.8341156243221399,41,3
355,"Th e model calculates production costs 
 based on three key inputs: (1) a cost-improvement slope, (2) a value for 
 the total number of units, and (3) the nonrecurring investment cost. ",1.0626522322226848,42,3
356,"
 Th e model includes some simplifying assumptions:
 • First, competition will equally split the quantities between the 
 two producers (it is not a winner-take-all situation). ",0.6448476207924378,42,3
357,"Th is fi rst 
 assumption represents a “worst case” scenario.",0.36762891871139897,42,1
358,"
 • Second, the model assumes that the additional investment cost is 
 equal to the sole-source investment cost. ",0.6965324529090854,42,3
359,"Th at is, each competing 
 producer’s nonrecurring costs are equal and do not change with 
 production quantity.",0.8246720476901719,42,3
360,"
 Table 1.3 presents the results of this calculation, based on a case 
 where the total production quantity is 1,000 units. ",0.7273153386524546,42,3
361,"Th e fi rst column 
 of the table represents the nonrecurring cost relative to the fi rst pro-
 duction unit cost; for example, a value of 5 in the fi rst column means 
 that the nonrecurring cost was fi ve times greater than the cost of the 
 fi rst production unit, and a value of 50 means that the nonrecurring 
 cost was 50 times greater than the cost of the fi rst production unit. ",0.8009655789300648,42,3
362,"
 Th e remaining column headings represent (in percentages) an extent to 
 which cost improvement may occur. ",0.8362990958622487,42,1
363,"For example, a cost improvement 
 of 95 percent means that unit production cost decreased by 5 percent 
 each time total production quantity doubled; a cost improvement of 
 100 percent means that unit production costs remained the same when 
 total production quantity doubled.",1.1550114820247268,42,3
364,"
 Table 1.3 clearly illustrates that competition is more reasonable 
 for situations where the nonrecurring costs are relatively low and the 
 cost improvement is minimal (fl at)—for example, when nonrecurring 
 costs are only 5 times greater than the cost of the fi rst production unit 
 and cost improvement is 100 percent, then the percentage of savings 
 in production needed to off set the costs of competition is only 1 per-
 cent. ",1.1389542463791997,42,3
365,"Note that RCR values (i.e., the results of the calculation) over 
 100 percent are cases where it is impossible to achieve savings. ",0.6859709844820814,42,3

 sonable to utilize competition (have dual

 CHAPTER TWO
 Untying Gulliver: Taking Risks 
 to Acquire Novel Weapon Systems
 John Birkler
 Introduction
 Traditionally, the defense acquisition system equips relatively large 
 forces for major combat operations involving weapon systems that are 
 produced in signifi cant quantities and intended to be operational for 
 decades. ",0.8474719791420836,45,4
396,"However, today there is a growing need to equip smaller forces 
 to respond to asymmetrical threats using novel weapon systems that 
 can be quickly developed and fi elded.",0.7869401789812948,47,0
397,"
 Novel systems—often an integration of several known technolo-
 gies, coupled with doctrinal and organizational changes—have more 
 uncertainty when compared to traditional acquisition programs, and 
 they present a challenge to the traditional acquisition process. ",0.6929770353486953,47,4
398,"Acquisi-
 tion policies and procedures in place today are designed to deliver new 
 systems based on a stable design to minimize risk. ",0.7122360814827795,47,4
399,"However, to quickly 
 fi eld innovative and novel systems, the acquisition community must 
 accept precisely the uncertainties and risks that the traditional acquisi-
 tion process has been deliberately designed to avoid.",0.6876900341504941,47,4
400,"
 Th e aversion to risk that is built into the current acquisition pro-
 cess impedes rather than encourages the development of novel systems, 
 especially those based upon disruptive rather than evolutionary tech-
 nology. ",0.7814211939778514,47,4
401,"Although DoD has established a number of organizations and 
 undertaken numerous initiatives to manage the identifi cation, test, and 
 deployment of novel systems, 1  creating capabilities in the absence of

 any expressed warfi ghter need—that is, “technology push”—contin-
 ues to run too much against the political, bureaucratic, and regulatory 
 grain of the defense acquisition process. ",0.9829127094669167,47,4
402,"If it 
 is allowed to continue, this aversion will have 
 serious consequences for the long-term quality 
 and capability of future U.S. combat forces. ",0.9185307987024274,48,0
403,"
 As near-term budget pressures and force 
 modernization needs mount, spending scarce 
 resources on capabilities that  might  become 
 available or that  might  produce fundamental 
 changes in mission capabilities is understand-
 ably viewed with little enthusiasm. ",1.0644031997262318,48,0
404,"Creating 
 an environment that fosters innovation and 
 novel system development is one of the tough, but fundamental, chal-
 lenges facing senior leaders in DoD.
 Th is paper argues that fostering innovative systems requires a sep-
 arate acquisition strategy that
 • focuses on technology push and unique integrations of existing 
 and emerging technologies;
 • emphasizes fl exibility, including an overt willingness to accept 
 risks;
 • allows easy and quick termination of programs not yielding 
 expected benefi ts;
 • enables early test and demonstration of military utility.",1.010371740091173,48,4
405,"
 In other words, we argue that fostering innovative systems requires a 
 strategy that is more streamlined and less tied to achieving precise esti-
 mated cost, schedule, and performance outcomes in order to provide 
 improved or unique capabilities to the warfi ghter as quickly as possible.",1.1183801677939191,48,4

 An acquisition 
 strategy for 
 developing 
 novel systems 
 cannot hinge on 
 achieving precise 
 cost, schedule, 
 and performance 
 outcomes. ",1.0049211054139933,48,4

 In this paper, we will fi rst defi ne what we mean by novel systems 
 and describe their special features, and then we will outline the neces-
 sary elements of a strategy for developing these systems.",0.8046974467062252,48,4
409,"
 What Is a Novel System?",0.18441443733842178,49,1
410,"
 Novel systems diff er from legacy or conventional systems on several 
 dimensions: design, operational employment, outcomes, production 
 run, and operational life. ",0.6048422190614042,49,4
411,"Figure 2.1 compares novel systems to conven-
 tional systems in terms of these dimensions (the descriptive adjectives 
 used are deliberately simplifi ed in order to emphasize the extent of the 
 diff erences).",0.5998874399169,49,0
412,"
 Conventional systems—for example, the Joint Strike Fighter, 
 the F-22 fi ghter, and the Navy’s new destroyer, DD(X)—may contain 
 the latest technologies, but this alone does not constitute a “novel 
 system.” ",0.5466206507655729,49,5
413,"We know how to classify conventional systems (e.g., tactical 
 aircraft, surface combatant); we know how we are going to use them; 
 they fi ll an offi  cial capability gap; and we know about how many we 
 plan to buy.",0.8051448233274836,49,0
414,"
 On the other hand, in novel systems—such as the F-117 Stealth 
 Fighter, novel mine-counter measures, and robotic ground vehicles—
 the following factors are less certain:

 CHAPTER THREE
 Dollar Value and Risk Levels: Changing How 
 Weapon System Programs Are Managed
 Robert Murphy and John Birkler
 Introduction
 Currently, acquisition programs are grouped and then managed at the 
 Offi  ce of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) by dollar value; depending 
 on the dollar value, OSD provides diff erent levels of oversight and 
 diff erent management processes. ",0.9265961583746265,55,5
492,"Th is approach has been constantly 
 refi ned over the years without having produced any noticeable 
 improvement in terms of reducing the cost growth, schedule slip-
 page, and performance shortfalls that continue to plague the acquisi-
 tion of weapon system programs. ",1.0695275034479352,57,4
493,"Th is paper argues for a diff erent 
 paradigm: ",0.30673294076527896,57,2
494,"Th e level of overall risk inherent in a program should be 
 the main basis for determining the process and level of review a proj-
 ect should receive. ",0.8099366819867003,57,4
495,"1
 Drawing upon examples from warship acquisition programs, 
 this paper also argues that inadequate assessment and management 
 of various discrete program risks result in adverse cost, schedule, and 
 performance outcomes. ",0.9383274242761463,57,4
496,"We examine existing scales for assessing some 
 of these discrete program risks and make recommendations to better 
 assess and manage several programs within the Defense Acquisition 
 Management System.",1.2504550511294963,57,4
497,"
 1  Cost is a factor that must be considered when determining the level of review. ",1.068942308298512,57,3
498,"A multi-
 billion dollar program requires high-level review because even a small amount of cost growth 
 involves large dollar amounts.",0.9666149254798759,57,3

 Managing by Risk Level Versus Dollar Value
 Currently, OSD requires review of acquisition programs and decisions 
 by senior offi  cials on the basis of a program’s dollar value, irrespective 
 of risk, as shown in Table 3.1.",0.9282589409016448,57,4
500,"
 ",0.0,58,-1
501,"However, some very costly projects 
 might have signifi cantly less risk than proj-
 ects of similar cost, and thus should require 
 less oversight as well as the use of diff erent 
 criteria at milestone reviews. ",1.2194459014812231,58,4
502,"2  Conversely, 
 projects may cost little but have a lot of 
 risk because they tend to push the state of the art in technology and 
 may also involve novel business or design processes that may require 
 more comprehensive oversight than just dollar value would otherwise 
 indicate. ",0.9605047394861247,58,4
503,"An excellent example of this type of program—the Advanced 
 SEAL Delivery System (ASDS)—was discussed in a May 2007 report 
 by the U.S. Government Accountability Offi  ce (GAO). ",0.7167960428021435,58,0
504,"Th e ASDS 
 is a Special Operations Forces’ battery-powered submersible carried 
 to a deployment area by a submarine. ",0.4442280245186296,58,5
505,"Th e operating parameters for 
 the submersible required development of batteries that would push 
 the state of the art in that technology. ",0.6382010537511645,58,5
506,"Th e initial design, construct, 
 and deliver contract was awarded for $70 million in 1994 for delivery 
 in 1997; because of the dollar value, Milestone Decision Authority 
 (MDA) resided with the Navy, which ultimately accepted delivery of 
 ASDS in 2003 in “as is” condition at a cost in excess of $340 mil-
 lion. ",0.8496778588820467,58,3
507,"GAO concluded that “had the original business case for ASDS 
 been properly assessed as an under-resourced, concurrent technology, 
 design, and construction eff ort led by an inexperienced contractor,

 at a cost in excess of several billion dollars. ",0.9909187469526871,58,3
508,"Over 60 destroyers of this class have already been 
 delivered or are in the fi nal stages of construction. ",0.37492543649188015,58,1
509,"Because of this track record, restarting con-
 struction of two new DDG 51s will no doubt expose the Navy to a far less risk of adverse cost, 
 schedule, and performance outcomes than construction of three multibillion DDG 1000-class 
 ships, which are now being designed and just entering construction.",0.7505728536160181,58,3

 cal risk is well understood in the acquisition

 allows time for proper assessment and management of technical risk 
 and, to some extent, of system integration risk. ",0.9340626943787157,72,4
706,"However, design, pro-
 duction, and business risks are not always adequately assessed and man-
 aged. ",0.6506987134421764,73,4
707,"As shown in this discussion, scales exist that represent good proxy 
 measurements of technical, systems integration, engineering, and pro-
 duction risks; what is missing are descriptive levels that could be used to 
 assess and categorize design and business process risk. ",1.001169046593027,73,4
708,"We recommend 
 that DoD explore establishing such levels and, in Tables 3.5 and 3.6, 
 off er starting points for doing so (based on the authors’ experience), 
 which may help program managers more carefully consider these risks.",1.042909913808695,73,4
709,"
 In addition, we recommend the following actions to better assess 
 and manage program risk overall:
 • Assess, categorize, and individually review each technical, system, 
 design, production, and business risk of a program at each mile-
 stone in the Defense Acquisition Management Framework.",1.2755937287869912,73,4

 CHAPTER FOUR
 Improving Acquisition Outcomes: 
 Organizational and Management Issues
 Irv Blickstein and Charles Nemfakos
 Introduction
 Despite years of change and reform, DoD continues to develop and 
 acquire weapon systems that it cannot aff ord and cannot deliver on 
 schedule. ",1.2320048976722453,75,5
751,"Th e U.S. Government Accountability Offi  ce reported, for 
 example, that research and development costs in 2008 for selected major 
 programs were 42 percent higher than originally estimated and that the 
 average delay in delivering initial capabilities had increased to 22 months 
 (March 2009, p. 1). ",1.0550004587878132,77,3
752,"Also, William Lynn, the new deputy secretary of 
 defense, stated that it will be very diffi  cult to sustain a force large enough 
 to meet demands if current acquisition trends continue. ",0.8163532417735483,77,5
753,"Th is suggests 
 that the new administration will have to fi nd ways to halt traditional cost 
 growth associated with fi elding new capabilities—or consider program 
 terminations (Lynn, 2009, p. 16).",0.7711884724092262,77,0
754,"
 Many of the problems that contribute to poor cost and schedule 
 outcomes are systemic to the way that the acquisition process is orga-
 nized and managed in DoD. ",0.9441722743599189,77,0
755,"It is our purpose in this paper to discuss a 
 few of these problems and how they may be contributing to ineffi  ciency 
 and unrealistic expectations. ",0.5564985250735448,77,0
756,"Th ese issues include
 • the service chiefs’ role in the acquisition process
 • the combatant commands’ (COCOMs’) role in the requirements 
 process
 • the impact of joint duty on the acquisition process
 • a growing emphasis on management processes at the expense of 
 workforce initiative.",0.9277505315418144,77,5

 and unrealistic 
 expectations in the 
 acquisition process.",0.5769741985980968,78,0
759,"
 The Service Chiefs’ Role in the Acquisition 
 Process Is Too Limited
 Stronger ties are needed between service leaders who understand 
 warfi ghting needs based on operational experience and those who are 
 responsible for acquiring weapon systems to meet those needs. ",0.9522129934614544,78,4
760,"Over 
 time, a schism has developed in some of the military departments 
 between the service chiefs, who validate war fi ghting requirements, and 
 the service acquisition chiefs who develop and 
 acquire new weapon and information systems 
 in conjunction with their program executive 
 offi  cers and program managers.",0.9368999630655028,78,5
761,"
 ",0.0,78,-1
762,"A large impetus for the schism was the 
 Goldwater-Nichols Act passed in 1986, which 
 was intended to improve unity of command 
 and push the military departments and the 
 Joint Chiefs of Staff  to instill a more “joint” approach to military opera-
 tions. ",0.9041464456508272,78,5
763,"Among its key provisions, the act established that only one offi  ce 
 in a military department was to have responsibility for that department’s 
 acquisition process, and that offi  ce would report to the secretary of the 
 military department (through a service acquisi-
 tion executive). ",0.8568650470135676,78,5
764,"In eff ect, the Goldwater-Nich-
 ols Act put the service chiefs on the sidelines of 
 the acquisition process.",0.6082465365089806,78,5
765,"
 At the time, there was some concern about 
 the impact of this step. ",0.470253524786125,78,3
766,"For example, Senator 
 Sam Nunn said he “was concerned that we not 
 create an impenetrable wall between the staff s 
 of the service secretary and the service chief” 
 (1985). ",0.5879719254864367,78,2
767,"As time has passed, it does appear that the service secretar-
 ies and the service chiefs, along with their respective staff s, are not 
 regularly engaging in meaningful dialogue. ",0.6882938451709716,78,1
768,"1  Without such dialogue, 
 1  For example, one program executive offi  cer told the authors that “they have substantive 
 discussions of my programs at the Pentagon, but I am not invited.”",0.583823904730656,78,5

 Service chiefs 
 have become 
 increasingly 
 disconnected from 
 the acquisition 
 process.",0.3876294061421292,78,5

 service chiefs may be intractable in emphasizing warfi ghting needs at 
 the expense of reducing cost where possible; on the other hand, the 
 acquisition process loses the operational insight that is critical in ana-
 lyzing trade-off s between cost, schedule, and performance.",1.214033671725985,78,4
771,"
 To mitigate this problem, the military department acquisition 
 instructions for each military department could be modifi ed to  explic-
 itly  state the duties and expectations of the service chiefs and their 
 staff s. ",0.7019988901304474,79,5
772,"As an example, these instructions could state that program deci-
 sion meetings, where acquisition decisions are made, could be chaired 
 by the service acquisition executive and the service vice chief. ",0.6222224223371943,79,5
773,"Such a 
 revision would send a broad message to those who develop warfi ghting 
 requirements that a link exists between the requirements process and 
 the acquisition process.",0.7984039659758225,79,0
774,"
 The Combatant Commands’ Role 
 in Defense Management
 Th ere is a prevailing theory in Washington, D.C., that acquisi-
 tion outcomes would improve if the combatant commands had a 
 greater role in DoD’s process for  determining warfi ghting require-
 ments . ",0.8820706029837626,79,0
775,"According to this theory, acquisition outcomes would improve 
 because the military departments would better attune themselves to 
 the warfi ghting capabilities that COCOMs need to have as well as 
 when they need to have them; on the other hand, acquisition out-
 comes would also improve because the COCOMs would have to 
 take fi scal constraints into greater consideration when identifying 
 the capabilities they want.",1.0238818290307712,79,4
776,"
 ",0.0,79,-1
777,Th ere is an historic precedent for this concept. ,0.3250616129351672,79,1
778,"Th e idea of 
 addressing warfi ghter needs more directly through participation of the 
 COCOMs in DoD’s decisionmaking processes emerged in the middle 
 1980s during the Reagan Administration. ",0.6841213793026059,79,5
779,"At that time, Integrated 
 Priority Lists (IPLs) were introduced to allow unifi ed and specifi ed 
 commanders (at that time known as commanders in chief, or CINCs) ",0.6132841370043415,79,5

781,"In concept, IPLs 
 were a compelling idea: the people who are in charge of operationally 
 leading our nation’s military would appear to be the logical ones to 
 determine what they need on the battlefi eld.",0.6681190202269917,80,0
782,"
 In practice, however, this approach did not improve outcomes. ",0.8365431155860259,80,4
783,"Th e 
 then CINCs did put together their lists, but each was quite diff erent 
 from the next, both in content as well as depth. ",0.4129402153356793,80,1
784,"Some were thought-out 
 and actionable (e.g., “I need 40 more Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-
 Air Missiles in my Area of Responsibility”). ",0.6393233559964223,80,5
785,"Others, however, were vague, 
 and it was unclear what action was needed to address the warfi ghting 
 need. ",0.9418448353001987,80,0
786,"Even when various administrations invited these senior military 
 leaders to Washington, D.C., to present their ideas, it was clear that they 
 were neither attuned to the requirements process nor to the acquisition 
 process and had not given suffi  cient thought to the content of their IPLs.",0.7304041450864976,80,0
787,"
 As the type of information in historical IPLs indicates, the com-
 batant commands are warriors equipped to fi ght today’s wars and to 
 prepare for tomorrow’s threats; they are not equipped for a major role 
 in developing comprehensive, detailed, and thus directly actionable 
 requirements for the DoD acquisition processes. ",0.9242711274514565,80,0
788,"Th is is quite under-
 standable. ",0.31198438817358504,80,1
789,"Th e COCOMs and their staff s need to spend their tour 
 of duty understanding their Area of Respon-
 sibility and their potential adversaries through 
 training, exercises, and building country-to-
 country military relationships. ",0.8431950077947364,80,0
790,"Taking a major 
 role in DoD management processes would 
 diminish their ability to carry out that mission, 
 and could lead to an excessive emphasis in 
 acquisition on near-term warfi ghting needs at 
 the expense of long-term capability planning 
 as well as to multiple and potentially duplicate 
 staff s, all of which would ultimately aff ect the acquisition process.",1.035205579077286,80,4
791,"
 Th e COCOMs’ input into the requirements and acquisition 
 processes is important and necessary, but current Title 10 allocations 
 of responsibility already refl ect the need to divide this labor by estab-
 lishing the military department secretaries and their service chiefs to 
 The current system 
 of checks and 
 balances between 
 the COCOMs and 
 the departmental 
 headquarters are 
 in an approximate 
 balance.",0.8272371436588849,80,0

 support the COCOMs by assessing and addressing their requests in 
 light of the funding available, the other demands of their individual 
 departments (e.g., manpower and support), the ability of the public 
 and private sectors to deliver what is possible, the condition of the 
 industrial base, and the amount of risk in a program.",1.1842674048753175,80,4
793,"
 In short, the current systems of the operational commanders and 
 the departmental headquarters already refl ect that the COCOMs can-
 not do everything and that the United States does not want to distract 
 the COCOMs from winning wars and achieving other military objec-
 tives and actions within their Area of Responsibility. ",0.7303100004065478,81,5
794,"It is the job of 
 those in Washington, D.C., to reach out to the COCOMs and demon-
 strate that their needs are being addressed, rather than turn the process 
 over to them.",0.6316184421375212,81,0
795,"
 Joint Duty Requirements Erode Operational Insights 
 Within Acquisition Program Management
 Eff orts to instill greater “jointness” in military operations have had an 
 unintended impact on the acquisition process, both diverting line offi  -
 cers away from management roles in the acquisition process and eroding 
 the management credibility of those offi  cers who do choose acquisi-
 tion duty assignments. ",0.7157023286445078,81,0
796,"Prior to the Goldwater-Nichols Act (which 
 required a military offi  cer to serve in a joint duty assignment in order 
 to achieve fl ag or general offi  cer rank), offi  cers could move between 
 “line” operational duty assignments and acquisition duty assignments. ",0.8454555942681602,81,5
797,"
 After the Goldwater-Nichols Act, they could no longer do so as readily 
 if they wanted to achieve fl ag or general offi  cer rank in an operational 
 role because of the limitations of time in a career. ",0.832260028327349,81,5
798,"Consequently, they 
 lacked the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the acqui-
 sition process by serving in acquisition duty assignments. ",0.6060695695182488,81,0
799,"Furthermore, 
 those who chose to devote their energies to the acquisition realm faced 
 erosion of their operational credentials and lacked credibility when, 
 for example, it came to determining whether a particular performance 
 requirement was truly needed.",0.814222137941919,81,0

 Finally, as the number of offi  cers serving in acquisition roles 
 decreased, a sense emerged of the acquisition process “belonging” to the 
 largely civilian material establishment, not the line offi  cers. ",0.7125548265682135,81,0
801,"Interviews 
 with program executive offi  cers, senior requirements offi  cials, and politi-
 cal appointees in the acquisition process have provided strong anecdotal 
 evidence that the channels of communications between the services’ 
 requirements and resourcing organizations (managed by line offi  cers) and 
 the service acquisition organizations are breaking down, and each realm 
 is making decisions on common programs without consulting the other.
 ",0.8969853815684643,82,0
802,"To improve this situation, the new administration could seek 
 legislative change to give key service acquisition positions the equiva-
 lence of joint duty when it comes to potential promotion to fl ag or 
 general offi  cer rank. ",0.7938299832875518,82,5
803,"It would then become much easier for offi  cers to 
 move fl uidly between operational and acquisition duty assignments, 
 increasing the linkage between these two realms and also increasing the 
 range of knowledge and expertise both of offi  cers participating in the 
 acquisition process and those serving to identify military requirements. ",0.7905707885347965,82,0

 Given the pressure on DoD’s acquisition system, accomplishing such a 
 change does not appear to be impossible.",0.6804994873987725,82,3

 Too Much Emphasis on Management 
 Processes over Creativity and Initiative
 Prescribing every step in the acquisition process has led to complexity, 
 rigidity, and delay—not cost savings. ",0.7643324700285618,82,4
806,"Th e instruction that governs the 
 department’s acquisition process (DoD 5000.2) has been under constant

 From the perspective of the acquisition professionals in the Offi  ce

 the wickets—not the application of logic, cost-cutting measures, or 
 technology. ",1.1568803218300807,85,0

 CHAPTER FIVE
 On Prototyping: Lessons from RAND Research

 Introduction
 Acquisition policy and practice refl ect the recurring theme that pro-
 totyping as part of weapon system development can improve program 
 outcomes. ",0.803185246646023,87,4
857,"Specifi cally, prototyping is widely believed to reduce cost 
 and time; allow demonstration of novel system concepts; provide a 
 basis for competition; validate cost estimates, design, and manufac-
 turing processes; and reduce or mitigate technical risk. ",1.0384618000065662,89,4
858,"1  A mandate 
 for competitive prototyping has periodically been included in revisions 
 to the DoD 5000 series of regulations governing the defense acquisi-
 tion system. ",0.8753551670511222,89,5
859,"Th e most recent revision to DoD Instruction 5000.02 
 (December 2008, p. 17) contains the following mandate:
 Th e TDS [Technology Development Strategy] and associated 
 funding shall provide for two or more competing teams produc-
 ing prototypes of the system and/or key system elements prior 
 to, or through, Milestone B. Prototype systems or appropriate 
 component-level prototyping shall be employed to reduce techni-
 cal risk, validate designs and cost estimates, evaluate manufactur-
 ing processes, and refi ne requirements.",1.3722981444230644,89,4

 refl ecting the waxing and waning of DoD interest in prototyping. ",0.38978875236779353,90,0

 We make only limited use of prototyping-related studies outside of 
 RAND research; these studies have also been episodic in their cover-
 age of prototyping.",1.0124753872374204,90,0

 In this paper, we fi rst defi ne prototyping and discuss the potential 
 benefi ts commonly attributed to it. ",0.43975744558203,90,0

 to determine how well those potential benefi ts are supported by experi-
 ence. ",0.8808186555230072,90,0

 sons and specify the conditions under which prototyping is most likely 
 to yield expected benefi ts.

867,"What Is Prototyping?
 ",0.1975460980451471,90,5
868,"In general, prototyping is a set of design and development activities 
 intended to reduce technical uncertainty and to generate informa-
 tion to improve the quality of subsequent decisionmaking. ",1.0694544938079997,90,4
869,"Although 
 the term “prototyping” captures a wide range 
 of activities, all prototyping has several ele-
 ments in common, including the design and 
 fabrication of one or more representative sys-
 tems (hardware or software) for limited test-
 ing and demonstration prior to a production 
 decision. ",0.9003492835943965,90,4

 being tested.",0.6317839182621605,90,1

 sions. ",0.6925415921758492,91,4
881,"(Drezner, 1992, p.9)
 In other words, prototypes are distinct from full-scale, fi nal confi gu-
 ration, production-representative test articles, the main purpose of 
 which is to verify that performance requirements have been met and 
 the program is ready to move into the production phase. ",0.8363656989992319,91,4
882,"Th e expecta-
 tion that prototyping will lead to change implies that a prototype is 
 intended as a vehicle to learn something about the system’s technology 
 or concept that will inform subsequent decisions. ",0.760005431216558,91,4
883,"Th e prototype itself 
 does not have to be a fully confi gured production article to accom-
 plish this purpose.",0.5028458738984909,91,4
884,"
 Prototyping can take many forms. ",0.2397423831023566,91,1
885,"It can be conducted at both 
 the system and subsystem level. ",0.6656898677936482,91,4
886,"It can include competition (e.g., 
 two or more teams designing, fabricating, and testing a representa-
 tive system in the context of a source-selection decision) or just a 
 single organization experimenting with a novel concept or new tech-
 nology. ",0.7344539302639654,91,4
887,"Some developmental activities (i.e., experimentation, system 
 concept and technology development, demonstration and validation) 
 are often not labeled as prototyping, but the nature of the activi-
 ties planned and accomplished is consistent with prototyping. ",0.7655059250151521,91,4

 example, Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD), Advanced

 However, it is important to note that prototyping alone does not con-
 stitute a full weapon system development program. ",0.6079390664617836,92,4
892,"When incorpo-
 rated into an MDAP, prototyping should be used together with design 
 analysis, empirical testing, modeling and simulation, and “other meth-
 ods of reducing technological uncertainty” (Perry, 1972, p.41) because 
 these other methods produce information that prototyping alone will 
 not; such approaches are complementary in the context of an MDAP. ",0.8804516098441422,92,4
893,"
 When prototyping is done outside of an MDAP, the transition and 
 transfer of technology and information becomes an important practi-
 cal issue aff ecting the value of the prototyping eff ort. ",0.777867272390351,92,4
894,"Unlike an MDAP, 
 which has a constituency who ensure the political and budgetary sup-
 port necessary to move the project forward, an ATD or ACTD pro-
 gram does not necessarily have the support of the military service for 
 which it ultimately may be intended. ",0.7293728638440169,92,4

 Some weapon types are generally too costly to prototype at the 
 system level (e.g., large naval surface combatants and complex satel-
 lites). ",0.693251013114358,92,4
896,"In such cases,  subsystem  prototyping is a cost-eff ective alternative 
 for reducing uncertainty. ",0.8507571838933219,92,4
897,"For instance, the DD(X) program (now called 
 DDG 1000, the Navy’s newest guided missile destroyer) successfully 
 used a series of engineering development models (EDMs)—that is, 
 prototypes of critical subsystems, such as the hull form, advanced gun 
 and its munitions, composite deck house, peripheral vertical launch

 evidence that prototyping benefi ted both programs:

 concerns about defense acquisition outcomes—cost escalation, reports 
 of improper payments to contractors, appeals fi led over source-selection 
 outcomes, schedule delays—pervade the popular press as well as DoD 
 audits and internal reports. ",0.9110180266767574,109,0

 Overuse or Inappropriate Use of Contractors
 Due to lack of data, we are simply unable to characterize when, where, 
 and why contractors are being used to provide acquisition-related ser-

 their use and characteristics may have changed over time. ",1.00403261032636,129,3

 take-away from these studies is that DoD makes substantial use of 
 contractors in performing acquisition-related functions and that this 
 use varies dramatically across functions, occupations, programs, and 
 organizations.",1.009930993883529,130,0

 Where Are Contractors Being Used?
 Targeted studies of the use of contractors to perform acquisition func-

 on contractors is highly variable. ",1.077809121229687,130,4

 Air Logistics Center) to as high as 89 percent 
 (Arnold Engineering Development Center). ",0.7888598851703883,130,5

 Contractors represent 31 percent of the work-
 force at acquisition centers, 23 percent of the

 percent of the workforce at test and evaluation 
 centers within AFMC. ",0.7616467385332717,130,5

 they were about as likely to have certifi cation in the area of cost esti-

1317,"Th e study also found that the Air 
 Force was relying on contractors to do the actual cost-estimating work,

 Why Are Contractors Being Used?
 ",0.5105184805143212,131,3
1321,"Th e targeted studies described previously suggest that the use of con-
 tractors to perform acquisition functions is not based on a comprehen-
 sive strategic assessment of the long-run costs and benefi ts of their use. ",1.2157812619372135,132,4
1322,"
 Th e studies also provide evidence that acquisition organizations are not 
 able to fi ll all of their requirements with in-house personnel for a range 
 of reasons, including resource constraints 
 and process barriers.",1.0193215712491093,132,4
1323,"
 In its review of staffi  ng for major weap-
 ons programs, GAO found that 46 out of 
 59 programs that responded to questions 
 about staffi  ng had received authorizations 
 for all required positions, but that only 42 
 percent of the programs were able to fi ll all 
 of their authorized positions (GAO, 2009a, 
 pp. 23–24). ",0.7937618898392498,132,0

1325,Only one cited cost considerations. ,0.8858237554254654,132,0
1326,"
 Over three-quarters of DoD acquisition programs reported that they 
 used contractors as a way to get around critical constraints: person-
 nel ceiling, civilian pay budget constraints, limitations with the federal 
 government hiring process, or a lack of in-house capability in a particu-
 lar area. ",0.9872675905231074,132,0
1327,"Th ese fi ndings echoed those from a prior study conducted by 
 the DoD Inspector General (DoD IG, 2006, p. 13).",0.6891216097467439,132,5

 GAO attributes DoD’s reliance on contractor support to a “criti-
 cal shortage of certain acquisition professionals with technical skills 
 as it [DoD] has downsized its workforce over the last decade” (GAO, 
 2008, p. 30). ",0.6962371237178133,132,0

 as reasons why the actual workforce fell short of requirements.",0.7609128484385699,133,0
1338,"
 The Workforce Lacks the Skills to 
 Accomplish the Workload
 Another common refrain in discussions about the state of the defense 
 AW is that the nature of the work has become substantially more com-
 plex, while the workforce has lost some of the skills or training needed 
 to perform this work. ",0.8730278651689525,133,0

 cussed earlier and are primarily attributed to increased use of best-value 
 procurement methods and the complexity of service contracts.",0.8328935327016382,133,3

 Evidence that the workforce lacks the skills necessary is largely 
 anecdotal, and the arguments are far less specifi c than those related to 
 workforce size. ",0.6294503525362481,133,0
1341,"A key barrier to assessing this perspective is a lack of 
 systematic data on the skill level of the workforce, not to mention the

 Sensitivity Checks
 To validate that the occupational series considered part of the AW had 
 not changed much between 1992 and 2007, we reviewed data on the 
 percentage of the DoD workforce counted as part of the AW by occu-
 pational series for FY 1992. ",0.9045443729773055,141,0

 as part of the AW rose between 1992 and 2007. ",0.34480182845281276,141,1
1434,"Among those occu-
 pational series where the share declined between 1992 and 2007, the 
 share of all occupational series members in the AW was well below the 
 one-third threshold in both years except in the case of occupational 
 series 1386 (Photographic Technology), where it was 34 percent in 
 FY 1992. ",0.5699438128341426,141,1
1435,"However, this is a small career fi eld (with only 26 members 
 DoD-wide in FY 1992 and seven in FY 2007) that does not seem to 
 be directly related to the acquisition; hence, we decided not to include 
 it in the analysis.",0.8195525089304054,141,0

 Welcome to the Government and Industry  Closing the Procurement 
 Gap Survey Report  on procurement challenges and recommended 
 improvements� 
 The Association of Proposal Management Professionals (APMP) is a strong community 
 of industry experts who participate in all phases of the business development, 
 capture, and proposal development lifecycle� ",1.1829494574663817,1,11
4,"As the leading industry association for 
 proposals and procurements, we represent the voice of our members without company 
 bias� As part of the APMP Procurement Improvement Committee (PIC) mission, we 
 conducted a survey to work collaboratively with U�S� Government and industry to 
 identify procurement challenges and to identify ways to improve the efficiency and 
 effectiveness of federal procurement� The results of the survey provide focus on 
 specific “calls to action” where rapid improvements can be made to enhance the 
 procurement process� 
 •	 Ask good questions and point out issues in DRFPs and RFPs, but give the 
 Government a solution that will work for all competitors�
 •	 Industry should respond seriously to RFIs and market surveys to help the 
 Government versus just throwing capabilities together� 
 •	 Stop protesting every deal� Identify issues, concerns, and worries, but stop 
 protesting on a whim to get the Government to award to everybody on IDIQs, 
 to drag out new contract starts to maintain revenue, or to attempt to thwart 
 procurements� If you protest, make sure you have a good reason, and can defend 
 that reason with certitude� 
 •	 Develop a checklist before filing a protest—force yourself to answer basic 
 questions such as, “Did the agency violate any procurement integrity rules, and if 
 so, which ones�” Force an internal pass/fail on frivolous protests to avoid knee-
 jerk reactions to losing�
 •	 Require your CEO to approve filing protests to prevent excessive protesting from 
 some business units�
 •	 Be a partner to achieve a successful procurement instead of an impediment� Help 
 with good analysis of risk, cost, probability of success, and paths to success� 
 •	 Talk to acquisition personnel (Program and Contracts) regularly and don’t go 
 above their heads in the procurement process� Help the Government create a 
 successful procurement�
 •	 Read your clients’ strategic and annual planning documents and come to visits 
 prepared so that you don’t waste their time� ",1.6647356709803942,3,3

 •	 Make white papers address the issue of achieving a successful procurement not 
 skewing the procurement to your favor�
 •	 Mandate that PCOs keep Government and industry communications open until 
 the final RFP release�
 •	 Flow-down direction to PCOs and Program Managers on the “Golden Rules of 
 Communications and Early Industry Involvement�” 
 •	 Eliminate Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) for services and only 
 allow for commodity products� If LPTA is used, require a thorough Technically 
 “Acceptable” review before opening the Cost Volume�
 •	 Include Sections L&M in draft RFPs�
 •	 Frequently publish and update DRFP and RFP projected release dates on a 
 website�
 •	 Seventy percent of Industry supported eliminating the “Alternate Proposal” 
 language�
 •	 Government should “murder board” their own RFPs� Better cross-checking 
 between sections� The Government should carefully review RFPs to ensure that 
 they are complete� Review boards should include experienced external support� 
 •	 Better Debriefings
  
 – Very seldom is there a beneficial exchange - due to the Government’s fear of a 
 protest�
  
 – Don’t be so risk adverse at debriefings�
  
 – Government has gotten so scared of protests that debriefs are now typically 
 short, rehearsed responses that don’t offer any guidance to bidders� Make this 
 truly interactive, like a teacher sitting down with a student to provide guidance 
 on how to improve�

 Survey Identified Issues
 Recommendations
 Major perception gap in Government and 
 Industry Communications:
 •	Two thirds of industry view 
 communications as problematic
 •	More than 90% of Government believe 
 they communicate for requirements 
 development, technology/solutions, 
 feasible acquisition strategies, and 
 potential sources
 •	Mandate that PCOs keep Government and 
 industry communications open until the 
 final RFP release
 •	Flow-down direction to PCOs and Program 
 Managers on OMB Myth-Busters memos 
 and the “Golden Rules of Communications 
 and Early Industry Involvement” 
 •	Hold more Virtual Industry Sessions
 •	Not knowing RFP timelines creates 
 significant uncertainty and waste� Little or 
 no attempt to communicate with industry
 •	Misaligned Sections L&M make the 
 proposal response and evaluation harder
 •	RFPs need to be improved and not 
 “cut and paste” � Multiple amendments 
 tend to have contradictions, additional 
 ambiguities, and problems
 •	Frequently publish and update DRFP and 
 RFP projected release dates on a website�
 •	More Draft RFPs and 1-on-1’s to improve 
 the RFP
 •	Include draft Section L&M in draft RFPs
 •	Appears to have simply discarded 
 performance value as important
 •	Predominance of stated and unstated 
 LPTA awards yields no room for value
 •	Eliminate Lowest Credible Price, 
 Technically Sound (LPTA) for services and 
 only allow for commodity products� More 
 rigorous and comprehensive definitions of 
 technical acceptability
 •	Publish premium ranges (e�g�, 5% 
 services; 10% systems)� ",1.529548098818246,5,5
13,"Tell industry what 
 carries the value� 
 •	Use more of the Objective/Threshold 
 method for performance
 Identify issues, concerns, and worries but 
 stop protesting on a whim to get us to award 
 to everybody on IDIQs, to drag out new 
 contract starts to maintain revenue, or to 
 attempt to thwart procurement� 
 •	Stop protesting every deal 
 •	Require your CEO to approve filing protests
 •	Develop a checklist before filing a protest, 
 force yourself to answer, “Did the agency 
 violate any procurement integrity rules, 
 and if so, which ones?” ",1.1930799342262193,5,12
14,"Force an internal 
 pass/fail on frivolous protests to avoid 
 knee-jerk reactions to losing�
 •	Many of our customers see industry as 
 the “bad guys“
 •	Understand that industry is not the enemy
 •	Be open, transparent and inclusive
 •	The Government should universally treat 
 industry as a partner and not a combatant
 •	Outreach to Industry – at least annual 
 briefings to industry on roadmaps and 
 upcoming procurements

 A positive survey finding is there is strong agreement in the need to reduce cycle time, 
 costs, and to improve the Draft RFP process� ",1.0465753024800324,5,6
16,"The survey posed the same questions 
 to both industry and Government respondents on what they would be willing to do to 
 improve the procurement process� The side-by-side comparison of responses shows 
 powerful alignment of straightforward actions as shown below� 
 Nominally, about 60 percent of Government officials surveyed (shown in  BLUE ) were in 
 favor of these eight specific actions� Industry answers (shown in  GREEN ) show over-
 whelming support mostly in the 70 – 90 percent range�

 Synopsis
 While industry respondents overwhelmingly said the Government will sometimes meet 
 with them (but it is hard to get those meetings), the Government respondents stated 
 that they use communication with industry to provide them with critical information 
 (requirements development, available solutions/technologies, and acquisition 
 strategies)�
 Both parties want more, and relevant communication during the early stages of 
 procurement� Government respondents expressed concern that industry “over 
 promises” their capabilities and therefore they don’t have accurate requirements or 
 cost estimates for the procurement� Industry on the other hand expressed concerns 
 that the Government is too “tight lipped” about a procurement, and therefore industry 
 can’t provide detailed enough information to be valuable�
 The “cone of silence” is generally regarded as coming down at the time of RFP 
 release, but many respondents noted that it was difficult to have exchanges with the 
 Government at the time of draft RFP, or even after an industry day�
 When asked if relationships between Government and industry are becoming more 
 adversarial or negative in the past, 31% of industry participants responded in the 
 positive� ",1.4255245128016782,10,3
65,"However, the same percentage of Government respondents (31%) stated that 
 is the same as it has always been� 
 Industry respondents said that they put their “best talent” on responses to RFIs, but 
 the Government respondents believed they only received moderately useful feedback� 
 The Government has come to expect “marketing fluff” during the RFI phase, and not 
 get the technical solution until proposals� Industry respondents noted that they believe 
 some RFIs to be only a formality and not really used for procurement improvement�
 Both Government and industry participants responded positively to Industry Days with 
 one-on-one interaction� Both parties also agreed that Industry Days should be held 
 early in the process to achieve success�

 Synopsis
 Communications is the key issue here� ",1.1960233565563891,16,5
98,"From the release of the DRFP through contract 
 award communication is critical to ensuring that everything is established to have a 
 successful procurement�
 Clearly Industry wants more and more effective communication through DRFPs and 
 questions and clarifications related to the DRFPs� ",0.928270672161774,17,5
99,"Additionally, Industry believes they 
 must be more complete and probably require multiple iterations to secure an RFP that 
 will not generate excessive questions� The Government recognizes this� ",0.7697460576422077,17,12
100,"The challenge 
 may be simply one of time and resources to create, respond to ideas, and modify 
 RFPs�
 RFPs are expected to be clean and clear� There is a strong Industry belief that better 
 RFPs will yield better proposals and solutions and cost less� There is a strong belief 
 that better RFPs will also result in fewer questions� Many believe questions could be 
 answered much better and should be answered more definitively and that due dates 
 should be extended when questions are answered late in the process� Government 
 responses appear to indicate that there is a belief that answers to questions are 
 currently adequate in many cases, but could be better in some�
 Responding to Evaluations Notices also requires attention� ",1.0354575793025707,17,3
101,"The allowance of time for 
 proper response, reducing requirements for change pages and excessive iterations 
 remain critical to Industry� Changes in approach appear to be essential to developing a 
 more reasonable process for dealing with clarifications and discussions�
 Communication and dialogue can solve many of the issues cited� Perceptions currently 
 indicate a gulf of understanding between Industry and Government that can be 
 reconciled through dialogue and the development of joint approaches to achieve better 
 procurements� The basis for understanding and improvement exists�

 It is important to know when an RFP is going 
 to be released to line up proposal resourc-
 es and consultants to help respond to the 
 RFP� When RFP dates slip, bid costs go up

 arrive and every day the RFP slips, it costs 
 more B&P money to keep the team ready to 
 respond� Which response best describes your 
 thoughts about RFP releases dates? ",0.9188891447321413,19,2
108,"Please 
 select ONE� When it comes to releasing RFPs 
 on schedule, I believe the Government does: 
 “Contracting Officers should post expected 
 dates for RFP release in a public area such 
 as FedBizOpps� If the data slips, within one 
 week, the CO should reset the forecast�”
 “In my experience, it is not uncommon for 
 dates to slip by weeks or months, even as 
 late as several days before the RFP was due 
 to be released� ",0.8969540197063559,19,2

 of Government procurements� We have seen 
 FBO notices issued that state that the RFPs 
 will be released in two weeks and then RFPs 
 are released months later� As stated in the 
 note to the question, it costs industry more 
 B&P money every time an RFP release date is 
 delayed�”
 “Stick to procurement schedules and update 
 industry when dates slide�”
 “When a date slips, an update should be pro-
 vided as to the anticipated release�”

 Gap Survey Report
 Additional Survey Comments and Recommendations
 “Some Draft RFPs are well written, but some are incomplete� The instructions and 
 evaluation criteria are important�” 
 “The Government should release more Draft RFPs to solicit input on the proposed 
 SOW� Industry best practices are usually better known by the contractors and these 
 best practices need to be requested and implemented by the Government to add value 
 and save money�”
 “Frequent communication with industry over the true release date is very important� 
 If the Government knows it is going to miss a deadline, they should let industry know 
 right away so that we can adjust our plans and budgets to accommodate the revised 
 release date� ",1.3378570703913784,21,13
131,"Otherwise, industry ends up exceeding proposal costs unnecessarily�”
 “The best way to improve Government’s chances of receiving a well-organized RFP 
 response that proposes a solution to truly meet their needs is to provide an RFP that 
 clearly outlines issues and needs, as well as what information is required and where� 
 These make it easier for vendors to respond and for evaluators to compare proposals 
 more equitably�”
 “When considering response timeframes, the Government should consider how long it 
 takes to pull an RFP together� The more complex the solution needed, the more time 
 needs to be provided to provide the best, most thoughtful answer for the Government� 
 ",1.3682946718801725,22,3

 Closing the Procurement 
 Gap Survey Report
 Synopsis
 Both Industry and Government believe there is room for improvement in the creation 
 of evaluation criteria and debriefs� Approximately 50 percent of Industry respondents 
 believe that the evaluation process is not rigorous enough, and that a winner is 
 often chosen prior to submittal� Many Government respondents said they use source 
 selection training for participants on evaluation panels, and use strict evaluation 
 criteria and follow FAR guidance to avoid protests�
 Both Industry and Government expressed a need for more post submittal discussions 
 or that more oral proposals would be beneficial� There are mixed feelings regarding 
 the use of post submittal questions� ",1.1606401564636175,22,13
133,"The majority of Industry respondents believe the 
 Government asks meaningful questions and uses the answers to help understand 
 and score proposals� Others believed the opposite was true� Industry also expressed 
 a concern regarding the additional cost accrued by answering questions and 
 resubmission� Most Government respondents said that the use of questions helps 
 clarify and understand the proposal for scoring� 
 Regarding the use of LPTA evaluation criteria, the majority of Industry and Government 
 respondents believe that the award goes to firms that are marginally credible and have 
 a high performance risk in order to save on cost� Most Industry respondents indicated 
 that ineffective companies were awarded contracts, which forces Government to modify 
 or cancel the contract� ",1.0090173169790795,23,3
134,"With that being said many Industry respondents commented 
 that LPTA should be used, but strictly for a commodity contract not a service contract�
 When asked about quality of submittals, the majority of Government respondents 
 believe that the proposals are too general and do not address all of the requirements� 
 Some believe that they are difficult to evaluate against criteria� A few more believe 
 that there is a lack of innovation and competition� Several of the comments from 
 Government respondents mentioned the need for clearer written requirements/criteria 
 in the RFP and expressed an interest in working with Industry on how to solve the lack 
 of competition�

 the risk of protests by:
 The Government did a more effective job of de-
 briefing so the losing bidders would understand 
 why they lost
 The Government put more rigor into the pro-

 carefully evaluated each proposal
 The Government had better communication with 
 industry to explain their requirements and com-

 Addtional Recommendations and Comments
 “Include more information during debriefings and trust that a more open dialogue 
 about why an offeror lost will ultimately lead to fewer protests�”
 “As with most procurement issues, the best way to help debriefings and reduce 
 protests is to have a clean, clear RFP—especially one that has understandable and 
 defendable evaluation criteria that easily maps to the proposal instructions�”
 “Get tough on frivolous protests� Why isn’t there a penalty for frivolous protests? ",1.304916954311951,30,5
179,"There 
 ought to be a fee to file that is refundable if you win the protest�”
 “Which side is willing to put the “us” back in “Trust”? ",0.4131413980159222,31,14

 leading to less information shared at debriefings leading to more protests has to end�”

 The survey asked the Government respondents to answer two 
 additional questions:
 GAO studies indicate typical “Best Value” average premiums are around 5%� ",0.7754997893366814,32,11
182,"My 
 organization would support larger premiums of 10 – 15% for a superior solution�

183,"My 
 organization would support larger premiums of 10 – 15% for a superior solution�
 The responses indicate that Federal Civilian agencies are more in favor 
 of paying a larger premium than their DoD counterparts, but a significant 
 number of both DoD and Federal Civilian respondents just “didn’t know”�
 The responses indicate that Federal Civilian agencies believe more often than 
 DoD that Government contractors make higher profits than their commercial 
 counterparts� When comparing these responses to those above, Federal 
 Civilian agencies are more apt to pay a higher premium, but they also know 
 that comes at a higher profit margin�
 Again, there are several responses in the “I Don’t Know” category, so this is 
 another opportunity to open dialogue with the Government�

 ",0.6401243989529808,32,14
188,"In summary, let’s revisit the five overarching challenges/themes 
 from the survey results�
 1. ",0.5738915046676636,33,14
189,"Improve government/industry communications   
 There is frustration about lack of communication, inaccurate information, and ",0.6815425540351272,33,4
190,"
 failure to reasonably update procurement schedules� Governement-industry 
 interaction is a good and desirable thing-- even after a DRFP is published, up to 
 when the RFP is released� The FAR not only allows this, but encourages it�
 2. ",1.0106269225574795,33,7
191,"Mend government and industry relationships, so that they are more 
 collaborative and less adversarial   
 Open communication between Government and Industry is not always occurring�  
 Draft RFPs are ignored because Industry fears releasing their solutions to 
 competitors� Procurement officials don’t respond to questions that could lead to 
 better bids for fear of advantaging one contractor, and thus laying groundwork for 
 protests�
 3. ",0.7346577706343913,33,4
192,"Use the appropriate Source Selection method   
 Too often LPTA is being incorrectly applied� Per FAR 15�101, best value continuum, 
 LPTA should only apply in acquisitions where the requirement is clearly definable 
 and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal� ",0.9880904848038831,33,0
193,"We have seen LPTA 
 being applied to procurements that present significant risk to the government 
 meeting its mission if the contractor fails�
 4. ",0.638618114238727,33,15
194,"Improve the RFP Quality and Release Process    
 Both Government and Industry believe draft RFPs can help resolve quality issues, 
 and industry feels strongly that Sections L and M are critical to include in all 
 drafts� Discrepencies in the final RFP among Sections C, L, and M prolongs 
 the procurement process through questions and, at times, protests� Like any 
 deliverable, taking the time up front to “get it right” will reduce ambiguity, decrease 
 costs, shorten acquisition timelines, and improve the quality of solutions tendered�
 5. ",1.3141940650221426,33,5
195,"Stop the protests    
 Protests are almost pro forma responses to a major competitive award� If they 
 haven’t already, the government often anticipates protests in their procurement 
 timeline� Justified protests benefit the taxpayer� Unjustified protests do not�

 Implementing Acquisition Reform:   
 The Decker-Wagner Army Acquisition Review 
  
 The Army Acquisition Review (AAR) panel, co-chaired by the Honorable Gilbert F. Decker and General (R) 
 Louis C. Wagner, Jr,  submitted a report to the Secretary of the Army, entitled “Army Strong: Equipped, 
 Trained and Ready, Final Report of the 2010 Army Acquisition Review” in January 2011 . ",0.9353100377627518,1,4

 Introduction  
  
 A deliberate acquisition process requires critical contributions from a diverse body of Army and DoD 
 organizations, each with different areas of expertise, ranging from requirements development, ",0.8685544618678834,1,14

 engineering, program management and testing to resourcing. ",0.9606244514415634,1,13
6," As expressed in the AAR, the key to 
 improvement lies in our ability to effectively harmonize these inputs over the life of an acquisition 
 program to deliver new capabilities on a timely and cost-effective basis. ",0.9761774736744184,1,10

 The benefits of these improvements to our processes and procedures may not be felt immediately. ",0.7331569518051378,1,9

 require extensive coordination and support. ",0.9748491460288943,1,9

 assistance from Congress. ",1.0590252300405696,1,11

 improvements with discernible benefits over the full lifecycle of acquisition programs, especially in the 
 case of future ACAT-1 programs. ",1.0193863709029078,1,10

 engineering changes for safety, Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM), and Life Cycle 
 Cost. ",1.2150763520807426,22,10

 •

 produced technology and better engineering. ",0.9558484143076293,22,12
289, Overall Risk = Low to Moderate. ,0.5625328014395101,23,17
290,"
  
 •  
 Type 4 program: New system, which provides a new innovative capability with developed, 
 proven technologies. ",0.9065503402366196,23,12
291,Overall Risk = Moderate. ,0.5634259862882763,23,17

 Overall Risk = High. ",0.5735746309507147,23,17

 Moderate, Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI) with Overall Risk = Low. ",0.7302146595693669,23,13

 Analysis: 
  
 The concern with such an approach stems from the fact that program risk is highly subjective and not so 
 easily categorized into a discrete set of archetypes. ",0.8272038036079705,23,17
296," Over their lifecycle, programs could migrate 
 between the categories above causing confusion and delay. ",0.6599123057892274,23,17
297," In DoD, while risk is not explicitly defined 
 within the ACAT level, there is an inherent association. ",0.6921053765378611,23,8
298,"  In general, larger $ programs tend to have 
 greater integration complexity, therefore greater risk. ",0.5903674123321022,23,17

 deciding the level of the ACAT. ",0.4984061096946649,23,8

 execution requires the Army to ascertain fundamental elements broader than just categorizing risks, to

 o   The system under design must possess a modular architecture to enable component 
 level testing prior to subsystems test; subsystems testing prior to full systems testing. ",0.8028095578887875,23,12
306," 
 This modular architecture should possess an isolation layer (also known as abstraction 
 layer) to prevent hardware modifications from impacting software and vice versa. ",0.5705733163433877,23,9

 o   Systems engineering cones-of-tolerance must be performed at the beginning of the 
 program to ensure that the designs have sufficient margin to meet requirements. ",0.8724321091975711,23,10

 predict. ",0.8691778523796548,24,10

 THE PSC ACQUISITION AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY AGENDA  
 Transforming for a Future of Improved Performance and Results 
  
 I.  
 Introduction  
 The U.S.",0.9176295635121693,1,11
1," government annually spends approximately $500 billion—almost half of its discretionary 
 budget—on the acquisition of goods and services, with services making up over 55 percent of all of 
 those acquisitions.",0.7690657681197094,2,2
2," However, to date, much of the attention to improving the processes through which 
 those goods and services are procured has centered on the acquisition of major weapons",0.7538365940856958,2,4
3," systems (and 
 services in support of these systems) and less on the increasingly complex and dominant role of services 
 and technology in meeting the government’s missions.",0.581829368464739,2,10
4," Even today, efforts continue within the 
 Department of Defense to apply its extensive processes for weapons systems acquisition to the 
 acquisition of services and information technology.",0.7603090754534284,2,7
5,"  
 But it is important to recognize that the acquisition of professional services and technology is vastly 
 different from the acquisition of major weapons",0.5434265916205726,2,10
6, systems or products.,0.4272368721917519,2,1
7," So too are the dynamics of the 
 marketplace.",0.20789614833303624,2,0
8," Specifically and most importantly, the acquisition of major systems takes place largely in 
 an environment where the government is effectively the only customer and the number of potential 
 providers is limited.",0.8208192085894649,2,12
9," Conversely, the professional and technology services sectors are broad and diverse 
 and include companies with widely varying degrees of engagement in the public sector.",0.6231541733093774,2,10
10," As such, in order 
 to ensure the optimal competition for ideas and solutions, any approach to the acquisition of these 
 services MUST adapt to this blended",0.7567626991519256,2,7
11," market and must lean heavily toward best commercial, as opposed 
 to government‐unique, practices and dynamics.",0.54391880071876,2,1
12," 
 In addition, it is clear that the current process for the government’s acquisition of professional and 
 technology services is too slow, and even calcified, and fails to incentivize innovation and creativity that 
 is available to help the government improve its mission outcomes.",0.9511194147715567,2,7
13," In large part, these challenges are 
 driven by a system that is designed to prevent failure rather than encourage innovation.",0.6891117838174267,2,10
14," It is a zero‐
 defect mentality that, in any environment, presents enormous barriers to effective, efficient, and 
 contemporary solutions.",0.48456353159416854,2,10
15," The federal workforce, which is among the most dedicated workforces in the 
 world, is given neither the tools nor the support to exercise critical thinking and judgment and instead is 
 rewarded for what are often the wrong strategic choices but that are nonetheless the “safest.”",0.7467198232771091,2,10
16," 
 While the acquisition of information technology brings with it certain unique characteristics, focusing on 
 IT acquisition alone is not sufficient.",0.6921419869041275,2,7
17," In the vast majority of acquisitions, technology is either the core 
 element of what is being procured or is a core enabler of the service",0.4334652849937688,2,4
18, being procured.,0.26957677966259636,2,8
19," Indeed, the 
 convergence of services and technology, illustrated in part by the move to cloud‐based services, is 
 changing the face and character of the marketplace as a whole.",0.5774022690404058,2,10
20," The impacts of that convergence will be 
 felt not only in the acquisition of information",0.38374626882288,2,4
21," technology capabilities, but the acquisition of most other 
 services that rely on technology for execution.",0.6936955068037193,2,7
22," Whether it is access to new applications or entirely new 
 technologies, the professional services sector is being affected as acutely as the technology sector itself.",0.520179707604351,2,1
23," 
 In other words, the traditional lines separating professional services from information technology have 
 been blurred almost to the point of extinction, and any effort to reform, or transform, acquisition must 
 be consistent with and reflective of these realities.",0.6696914741352489,2,7
24," 
 2  
  
 This agenda is the result of extensive internal discussions and analyses conducted by members of the 
 PSC Board of Directors to respond to specific information requests from the U.S. Congress and to inform 
 a range of other acquisition and technology policy initiatives.",0.9861697402853752,2,11
25," It includes recommendations that are 
 pertinent to all aspects of services acquisition as well as recommendations that are more directly 
 relevant to one or more individual market segment(s).",0.9034769925580386,3,3
26," Taken together, they represent an important part 
 of a much broader PSC acquisition and",0.5620476987160623,3,4
27, technology,0.3409160096531375,3,10
28, policy action agenda.,0.7332531729435695,3,8
29,"  
  
 In the main, the report is premised on several factors: 
  
   
 Today’s services “market” is not one market; it is an amalgam of diverse functional 
 capabilities.",0.6548834851331022,3,7
30," The diversity of these capabilities requires an acquisition system characterized 
 by flexibility and risk‐based critical thinking to ensure that the acquisition strategies chosen 
 are appropriate to the desired outcome, rather than founded on an overly simplistic set of 
 assumptions and processes.",1.0022733427916575,3,12
31," 
  
   
 The current market is cyclical, in that new capabilities advance to a “commodity” phase 
 more rapidly than ever but then often goes through multiple additional cycles of 
 development and modernization.",0.783068232616188,3,4
32," 
 o   The use of “lowest price technically acceptable”",0.8003535216365261,3,9
33," acquisition strategies, or “best 
 value” acquisitions that ultimately default to a price shootout, inhibit continued 
 improvement and innovation and should be avoided for all but the most basic, static 
 commoditized services.",1.0719805764169439,3,12
34," One of the greatest dangers to the government’s effective 
 utilization of critical services is a tendency by the federal customers to 
 “commoditize”",0.6314361754135129,3,12
35," capabilities that are not, in practice or fact, commodities.",0.5549727779031436,3,1
36," 
 o   The use of a risk‐focused taxonomy, as defined in the  2013 PSC Leadership 
 Commission Report  (and reiterated in this report) must be core to the development 
 of any acquisition",1.0140802173927634,3,11
37, strategy or model.,0.5520385633264692,3,10
38," 
 o   The use of statements of objectives (SOOs), vice traditional statements of work 
 (SOWs)",0.6651123994421724,3,1
39,", is critical.",0.8579172004440949,3,10
40," Only through the use of SOOs, which focus on performance and 
 outcome, can providers continually innovate, insert new technology where 
 appropriate, and deliver optimal outcomes.",1.08950890370479,3,12
41," 
  
   
 The time is right for major change, not just incremental reform.",0.8336621582241734,3,10
42," 
 o   The current combination of workforce challenges and changes, budget sensitivity, 
 and the complexity of missions demands modern business and workforce models, 
 not simply the “reform” of antiquated models.",0.9975692732440558,3,10
43,"  In addition, the digital age requires 
 different expertise, approaches and solutions.",0.6455383388956435,3,1
44," 
  
   
 Smart acquisition will center largely on maximizing resources for investment in innovation 
 and continuous improvement vice sustainment of existing systems.",0.9339503650750592,3,10
45,"  
  
   
 The increasingly rapid evolution of technology and technology applications demands an 
 acquisition system with four key attributes: 
  
 3  
  
 o   Speed to outcome, both in terms of an acquisition process that reflects the market in 
 which services are being procured AND in terms of the ability of a solution or service to 
 deliver real results.",0.7843942371346085,3,12
46," 
 o   Agility, principally driven by a focus on modular development and implementation 
 (where appropriate) and a concomitant focus on the problems to be solved vice fulfilling 
 government‐specified “requirements” 
 o   Optimal transparency and competitiveness 
 o   A recognition that some degree of risk is inevitable; that a zero‐defect environment is 
 impossible to achieve and would be unaffordable 
 With these basic tenets in mind, our acquisition transformation agenda is divided into six categories: (1) 
 workforce, (2) pre‐solicitation, (3) solicitation/evaluation, (4) post‐award/performance, (5)",1.1453162296152173,4,12
47," ensuring a 
 competitive industrial base, and (6) general/cross‐cutting recommendations.",0.6862261461201289,4,11
48," While divided into distinct 
 categories tied intentionally to the acquisition lifecycle, few of these recommendations can or will by 
 themselves lead to meaningful improvement in a vacuum.",1.03968414028752,4,4
49," The entire ecosystem requires serious and 
 sustained leadership attention.",0.9815307524520266,4,10
50," Absent that focus, the performance and cost improvements the taxpayer 
 has a right to expect will continue to prove elusive.",1.1566350911086716,4,12
51," 
  
 II. ",0.2125503152262221,4,8
52," 
 Workforce 
 Problem:  The federal workforce is in the early stages of its most massive transition in decades.",0.714308878680803,4,10
53, ,0.0,4,-1
54,"This is 
 most pronounced in the technology workforce, where there are 10 professionals over 50 for every one 
 under 30.",0.4178442441949862,4,10
55, ,0.0,4,-1
56,"In the acquisition workforce, the transition has already begun and the new generation of 
 professionals are already being trained and oriented to traditional acquisition practices and rules—even 
 though the rapidly shifting market",0.8049460240578146,4,10
57," landscape requires very different strategies going forward for what 
 services to buy and how to buy them. ",0.6443945230422531,4,1
58,"  
  
 Recommendation:  Embark on a clear, steady and significant workforce transformation initiative in which 
 cross‐functional development, business acumen, technical skills and new and creative training and 
 education tools form the core.",0.9720296515687589,4,10
59, ,0.0,4,-1
60,"This initiative, at a minimum, should include the following: 
  
 1)  
 Amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to rename OFPP the “Office of Federal 
 Acquisition Management and Policy” (OFAMP) and give it explicit policy and workforce 
 authority over the full acquisition process rather than just contracting.",1.0367519546170325,4,11
61," 
  
 Rationale: As the primary federal agency guiding government acquisition, expanding OFPP’s 
 current authorities and role is an essential first step in better integrating the full acquisition 
 process and workforce.",1.058274126636152,4,7
62," Too often, particularly in the civilian agencies, “acquisition” is 
 equated with “contracting” when, in fact, contracting is but one critical element in the 
 acquisition process.",0.6737934811119971,4,7
63," And while OFPP has attempted to establish a set of program 
 management requirements, the office’s ability to enforce such standards",0.9655465924831149,4,3
64," absent clear 
 statutory authority remains in question.",0.47052496743851707,4,2
65," 
  
  
 2)  
 The Office of Personnel Management, in conjunction with the restructured OFAMP, should 
 create a clearly defined career path for program",0.777905638908315,4,4
66, management in the civilian agencies.,0.49782863702913543,4,11
67," 
 4  
  
  
 Rationale: The civilian agencies, unlike DoD, have no clear cut, aspirational career field for 
 program managers.",0.6613030976297136,4,11
68," OMB and surveys by others have documented over the years that, in 
 too many cases, “project managers” are equated to “program managers”",0.665045541299478,5,4
69," and/or individuals 
 responsible for signing certain documentation are deemed to be “program managers” 
 whether or not they have the requisite training and skills.",0.8144500375375221,5,5
70," The career path should include, in 
 addition to well understood systems engineering and related skills, numerous early 
 functional rotations, contemporary training opportunities, and rotations in the private 
 sector, all of which are essential to developing well rounded program",0.9841558429104025,5,7
71, managers and leaders.,0.657744066546174,5,10
72," 
 To their credit, OFPP and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council have already begun to 
 develop skills definitions and standards for program managers, but no actual career path 
 currently exists.",0.8550639917558188,5,11
73," In a government that is largely managed through “programs,”",0.47189854758839833,5,4
74," this is a 
 critical workforce gap that must be addressed.",0.7101800639665663,5,10
75," 
 3)  
 OFPP/OFAMP and OPM should immediately institute new acquisition workforce rotational 
 requirements to include mandatory cross‐functional rotations AND training.",0.9891920662715472,5,11
76,"  Similarly, 
 opportunities for rotations into the acquisition field should be provided to end‐users, 
 auditors, and others to gain an appreciation of the work required.",0.7107658069487495,5,5
77," 
 Rationale: It has long been a best commercial practice to expose developing talent to all 
 aspects of a business’s operations to ensure that, as they begin to specialize, they 
 understand the intersections and perspectives across the enterprise.",0.7664050348930995,5,7
78," Government workforce 
 development, on the other hand, is almost entirely insular and confined to a single 
 functional category.",0.5139387629596104,5,4
79," By changing that paradigm, and requiring that acquisition professionals 
 gain experience across the organization – in finance and accounting, budget, operations, 
 etc., – the government will be developing a more well‐rounded acquisition community than 
 ever before and will help ensure closer alignment between the acquisition professionals and 
 their internal customers.",1.0800754704548956,5,7

 with the acquisition workforce.",0.49749544840595394,5,11

 4)  
 OPM, in conjunction with OFPP/OFAMP, should create a new career path for “technology 
 management.”",0.5658350339776019,5,10
82," Unlike previous recommendations for the creation of IT contracting cadres, 
 this career field would borrow from best commercial practices and lead to the development 
 of a defined, fully supported, career field that combines critical business acumen and skills 
 (including acquisition) with technology knowledge and expertise.",1.2102067865776522,5,7
83," 
  
 Rationale: One of the longest standing and most widely acknowledged challenges in 
 government is that it maintains strong siloes of work.",0.6573125814930576,5,4
84," The creation of a highly skilled, hybrid 
 technology management workforce will both enhance the government’s internal capacity to 
 direct and oversee its growing technology needs and help to emphasize customer‐centric 
 decision‐making, as opposed to the current functional compliance emphasis.",1.0508226963293195,5,7

 5)  
 Create an Acquisition Excellence Council (AEC), under the auspices of OFPP/OFAMP, 
 comprised of government, industry and academic experts, to review and, where necessary, 
 overhaul current federal acquisition education programs and institutions to ensure that the 
 training and education of the acquisition workforce is both current and forward looking,

 mitigation, and emphasizes critical thinking and decision‐making.",1.0558556406425208,6,10
87," 
  
 Rationale: Surveys conducted by the Professional Services Council and others have clearly 
 documented that federal acquisition leaders do NOT believe their workforces have

 investments and the continued expansion of “brick and mortar” federal acquisition training

92," 
  
 6)  
 As the AEC is formed and conducts its initial reviews, OFAMP/OFPP, in collaboration with 
 the Undersecretary of Defense (AT&L), should launch a pilot program to identify and test 
 alternative acquisition workforce training and development tools.",1.0682513114256156,6,11
93," The pilot program should 
 include an open competition for tools that rely on contemporary online/interactive 
 capabilities, focus on outcome‐based performance management, and more.",1.022434832257015,6,7
94," 
  
 Rationale: The acquisition workforce is the vital foundation upon which nearly 50 percent of 
 the federal discretionary budget is executed.",0.8031112531100968,6,11
95," Improved training and development is not only 
 a necessity, it is highly",0.8987268463288225,6,10

 topic areas, the APRC chose to align the recommendations to track three of the basic milestones in the 
 life‐cycle of the government’s acquisition process: (1) pre‐solicitation; (2) solicitation/evaluation; and (3) 
 post‐award/performance.",1.2727622489458819,20,7
386," In addition, our first area for substantive action recommendations focuses on 
 workforce issues because no discussion of acquisition or technology",1.1482168751110222,20,7
387," policy transformation can be 
 complete without addressing – and extensively changing – both the demographics of and the training 
 tools and techniques for the acquisition workforce.",1.015377807138411,20,10
388," Regrettably, however, for far too long more has 
 been said than has been done.",0.35944641411479433,20,0
389," Our recommendations provide new approaches to addressing the critical 
 roles and skills of the acquisition",1.2005660137496195,20,7
390, workforce.,0.0,20,-1
391,"

 Similarly, the changes that are taking place in the technology applications being sought after by 
 government and being used by contractors also requires a significant refresh of the rules of the road.",0.8871422118208311,20,12
392," 
 But not all of these changes need to come in the acquisition process, however, and the report includes 
 recommendations addressing these areas throughout the report, including in the segment that 
 addresses the importance of preserving and expanding the competitive industrial base and in the 
 segment on general and cross‐cutting matters.",1.2527628881794168,21,7
393," The growing convergence between technology and 
 services necessitates transformative thinking about how the government acquires solutions from the 
 private sector.",0.5105910250856901,21,10
394,"   
 We value the confidence in PSC’s analyses and recommendations placed in us by members of Congress 
 and their staffs and the senior agency leaders as they consider these important issues.",1.1642781466096894,21,7
395," The federal 
 acquisition ecosystem is at a critical crossroad and presented with a timely opportunity.",0.608462474716756,21,5
396," We look 
 forward to contributing significantly to making meaningful and effective change.",0.7518700696355104,21,10

 Over the course of the last three decades, there have been numerous 
 analyses, reports, and initiatives designed to generate meaningful 
 improvements in the federal government’s performance. ",0.9896379010283951,29,4
1770,"Some have 
 focused broadly (e.g., National Performance Review, Government 
 Performance and Results Act), some more narrowly (e.g., Federal 
 Acquisition Streamlining Act, Clinger-Cohen Act, E-Gov Act, and 
 the National Commission on the Public Service ). ",0.9588588064703795,30,11
1771,"Each has contained 
 important and valuable recommendations. ",0.8606141698922817,30,4
1772,"And each has resulted in 
 some measurable improvements.",0.9740541177917901,30,0
1773,"
 Nonetheless few would argue that the federal government today is on 
 a positive, sustainable path toward optimizing its operations and its 
 delivery of services to the American people. ",0.8392140114472844,30,10
1774,"Longstanding, seemingly 
 intractable, systemic pressures; new and daunting fiscal and human 
 capital crises; and growing functional and mission disconnects have 
 left the federal government at one of its most difficult points in its 
 post-World War II history.",0.6367026089960932,30,10
1775,"
 ",0.0,30,-1
1776,"Thus, the PSC Leadership Commission has sought to address one 
 significant, albeit partial, set of those challenges: the intersection 
 of federal human capital, acquisition and technology. ",0.9154673478061737,30,11
1777,"It is our view 
 that, by addressing substantively and aggressively some of the more 
 prominent challenges impacting those crucial aspects of government 
 operations, meaningful change can and will occur and a tone and 
 path charted for further fundamental change of the type needed to 
 meet the demands of the current times and into the future. ",0.8990527368604101,30,12
1778,"
 Indeed, it is our view and vision that the challenges of today and the 
 mandate for change they present represent equally great opportunities 
 to make real progress toward a government that encourages and sus-
 tains people, innovation and performance through the use of smart, 
 thoughtful and evidence-based business, programmatic and contem-
 porary practices. ",1.0960350881455592,30,12
1779,"Rather than remaining stuck in its past, we envision 
 a government moving forward on a refreshed and energized path.",0.40455235793614996,30,0
1780,"
 ",0.0,30,-1
1781,"The Commission’s internal deliberations and its discussions with 
 numerous external stakeholders were framed by six basic tenets:
 •  Massive change has surrounded and engulfed the government. ",0.628770972638383,30,4
1782,"That 
 “change” is both internal and external and only some of it is within 
 the power of government to control. ",0.7581331744343931,30,1
1783,"But it must be leveraged 
 so that the force of change can be used to launch long-term 
 improvement rather than be allowed to further wither and weaken 
 the government of today and tomorrow.",0.8126623996628124,30,10
1784,"
 •  There are a number of near-term steps that can be taken, most 
 without legislation, that can serve as the building blocks for more 
 in depth change that will result in real process and performance 
 improvements. ",1.0752550482522603,30,12
1785,"
 •  Any recommendations for change must evolve from a holistic, 
 multi-functional perspective, reflective of the “whole of 
 government,” including government employees, industry, non-
 profits and others implementing partners. ",1.0175402532683622,30,7
1786,"
 •  The application of innovative technologies, solutions, processes and 
 business models can provide the government with game changing 
 opportunities during these challenging times. ",0.8493051418470224,30,7
1787,"
 •  The responsibility for accepting and pursuing change and 
 driving excellence is a shared one. ",0.540989829404446,30,10
1788,"Each segment of the “whole of 
 government” must be a willing and collaborative contributor in the 
 process. ",0.41658381063175376,30,1
1789,"Rare is the case where a failure to achieve excellence can 
 be laid at the feet of just one component; likewise, rare is the case 
 where great success can be attributed to any one component.",0.5850684820549642,30,0
1790,"
 •  While all aspects of government operation must be a part of the 
 solution, the greatest returns will be gained through a clear and 
 persistent focus on the people from all entities that perform the 
 government’s work. ",0.8565071349357645,30,12

 The challenges of today 
 and the mandate for 
 change they present 
 represent equally great 
 opportunities to make 
 real progress.",0.9175246946574892,30,10

 Through its work, the Commission arrived at key findings, each of 
 which is important, but which together offer a road map forward. ",0.638364582146648,30,0
1793,"
 Those findings are detailed in the next sections of this report as are 
 the recommendations derived from them. ",0.8964230675546193,31,11
1794,"Some recommendations 
 are near term, some long term; some complicated and difficult, some 
 simpler. ",0.6742532209968595,31,0
1795,"The key recommendations resulting from these findings are 
 summarized as follows:
 •  ",0.8636666701622623,31,4
1796,"It is time to fundamentally rethink and revise current human 
 capital strategies, including planning, development, performance 
 management, and, in some cases, structures. ",1.1515044495356814,31,7
1797,"It must be recognized 
 that whatever has been done for the last two decades simply is not 
 delivering the desired results, and future-focused human capital 
 initiatives must not be based on present or past presumptions. ",0.6883449591551729,31,7
1798,"
 •  Collaboration must become a central component of government 
 operations, internally and externally. ",0.40346754913965377,31,10
1799,"This means that all 
 participants, inside and outside of government, must be working 
 toward and evaluated against a set of common performance and 
 mission measures.",0.9281192240707375,31,12
1800,"
 •  Industry, and all other components of the “whole of government,” 
 must demonstrate a sustained commitment to being a pro-active 
 partner with government in the search for solutions. ",0.6670001484286103,31,1
1801,"Similarly, the 
 government must view and treat those components as partners, even 
 as it exercises strong and appropriate oversight and management of 
 their work. ",0.7163322757756965,31,7
1802,"
 •  Filling the growing leadership void in government must be a priority 
 for the executive and legislative branches. ",0.6476483086719915,31,10
1803,"
 •  The government must seize this moment of change and reap the 
 significant benefits by establishing and embracing a culture of 
 excellence and innovation. ",0.7880737095734719,31,10
1804,"This will require a structured approach 
 to making investments through R&D funding and incentives that 
 promote collaboration.",1.034225213250397,31,7
1805,"
 •  Given the centrality of acquired services of all kinds to the proper 
 functioning of government today and tomorrow, there is an abject 
 need for a common taxonomy of services to drive smart and 
 appropriate business and acquisition strategies.",0.710069712996621,31,12

 Re: Defense Acquisition Regulations System Request for Public Comments on Review of Statutory and 
 Regulatory Requirements 
  
 CODSIA Case 02-14 
  
 Dear Mr. Canales: 
  
 On behalf of the Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations (CODSIA) 1 , we are pleased to have 
 the opportunity to work with the Department of Defense (the Department) as they conduct a Review of 
 Statutory and Regulatory Requirements first published as a request for public comment in the  Federal 
 Register  on February 12, 2014. ",0.998604038687201,59,8
2394,"We believe that now, more than ever, a review of the many unique cost-
 drivers built into the defense market is paramount to achieving mutual success in an austere budget 
 environment. ",1.0409751571272299,59,12
2395," 
  
 Attached to this letter is a list of burdens and barriers facing the defense industrial base (DIB) today. ",0.49453821187292873,59,11
2396,"
 Because these burdens are based in both statute and policy it is crucial for all regulations to be reviewed 
 to achieve maximum savings. ",0.8898197922225359,59,3
2397,"Accordingly, we believe that it should become a priority for the 
 Department to review their acquisition regulations on an ongoing institutional basis in order to ensure 
 that all policies and procedures are serving their intended purpose and are not duplicative or erroneous. ",0.7875545688245309,59,3
2398,"
 Indeed, many of the challenges and barriers–to-entry to the federal marketplace today also existed 
 twenty-five years ago. ",0.49898025114561295,59,10
2399," Many acquisition regulations, guidance documents, and policies implemented 
 over the past decade have eroded the underlying acquisition process originally designed by the seminal 
 streamlining statutes to keep the federal public sector market competitive, open to the latest 
 innovations and the commercial companies that develop them and able to sustain a technological 
 superiority over our adversaries. ",0.9845999029548104,59,1
2400,"
  
 1   CODSIA was formed in 1964 by industry associations with common interests in federal procurement policy issues 
 at the suggestion of the Department of Defense. ",0.6984225258433837,59,11
2401,"CODSIA consists of seven associations – the Aerospace Industries 
 Association (AIA), the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), the Information Technology Alliance for 
 the Public Sector (ITAPS), the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), the Professional Services Council 
 (PSC), TechAmerica, and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. ",0.6624765427408218,59,8

 thousands of government contractors nationwide. ",0.44477933118172286,59,0

 of its members’ positions regarding policies, regulations, directives, and procedures that affect them. ",0.8626774866103628,59,11

 any member association to abstain from participation in a particular case is not necessarily an indication of dissent. ",0.5394719707285645,59,0
2405,"  
                                                            
 During our own process of aggregating this information, we saw patterns emerge that may prove useful 
 as you analyze the responses and conduct a more thorough evaluation of all Department regulations, 
 guidance, and policy. ",0.8334575000236731,59,4
2406,"The majority of our responses are grouped into five distinct categories: 
  
 Uniformity, Standardization, and Consistency 
 To drive more efficiency into acquisition regulatory processes, the Department must eliminate 
 duplicative or redundant requirements, whether those requirements are created through the 
 transaction data collection, reporting processes, or agency-unique regulatory variants in the 
 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) or Service Supplements that are not 
 harmonized with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). ",0.8132824989446327,60,3
2407,"The requirements of many variants 
 drive significant overhead costs, because they cannot be standardized by industry into a uniform 
 or common business framework. ",0.8045535158274789,60,12
2408," The attached spreadsheet reflects areas where industry believes 
 a policy or process has been put in place that is duplicative of existing requirements or that has 
 the potential to increase complexity and cost because it is not uniformly implemented for 
 whatever reasons. ",0.959903032236463,60,12
2409,"   
  
 Process versus Outcome 
 ",0.4919412244612581,60,5
2410,"Too frequently, costs in the acquisition process appear to be driven by an aversion to risk within 
 the Department. ",0.7762975028148552,60,12
2411," Rigid procedurals requirements battle with the need to think through an 
 acquisition. ",0.6407638500111914,60,10
2412," We believe the system will benefit from direction to “keep eyes on the ball” which 
 will, in turn, rein in the tendency to dictate overly complex regulations. ",0.42811833822134426,60,0
2413,"  Many current contracting 
 and administration processes reflect an acquisition system built to hold all vendors accountable 
 for the contractual bad acts or the misbehavior of a small number of contractors. ",0.7271168693126531,60,3
2414,"Contractors are 
 increasingly forced to comply with regulations that seek to unearth non-compliance on a zero 
 tolerance, strict liability, basis. ",0.5899084129331104,60,9
2415," Such regulation seldom factors in the cost of compliance to 
 government or industry. ",0.7026785274877034,60,3
2416,"The attached spreadsheet reflects areas where industry believes there is 
 an imbalance between process compliance and outcomes where changes could reduce 
 government and industry costs, at the very least in the subcontracting and flow-down processes, 
 without increasing the government’s exposure. ",0.9918330267009431,60,12
2417,"  We also believe that re-emphasizing the 
 management of compliance will reduce acquisition policy risk. ",0.787606581170351,60,7
2418,"
  
 Oversight 
  
 The Department’s acquisition oversight system is overly complex, overly costly, and is not aligned 
 with industry or global best practices. ",0.8882549013279142,60,7
2419," Acquisition oversight has grown dramatically and reflects a 
 complex set of government goals and priorities involving a variety of requirements that require an 
 ongoing and externally driven review and approval process by the Department’s employees. ",1.0991879311679824,60,7
2420,"Such 
 a framework is costly for industry to staff—and the Department to enforce—and could be 
 mitigated by adopting the changes set forth in the attached spreadsheet. ",1.0215421623556693,60,4
2421," To some extent, the 
 Department has already taken such strides; the risk-based process at the Defense Contract 
 Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) recognizes that 
 oversight has a price that is reflected in the products and services DoD acquires. ",0.9335500563490114,60,3
2422,"  
  
 A complementary approach to facilitate a modern oversight framework might be for the 
 Department to invest in the automation and digitization of its data and oversight processes, which 
 2 
  
 could allow for near real-time Department insight into risk and compliance anomalies. ",0.7565095374732242,60,7
2423,"Industry is 
 open to discussing this further. ",0.275985193082598,61,10
2424," 
   
 Commercial Preference  
  
 It is beyond dispute that innovation is driven today by the private sector. ",0.4536213114236222,61,10
2425,"By honoring the 
 statutory preferences for commercial item products and services and the use of commercial 
 transaction processes set forth in the FAR and DFARS, the government can leverage the latest 
 state-of-the-art technologies, increase competition in federal procurements, and reduce costs 
 associated with government-specific requirements. ",1.1802311654850373,61,3
2426,"Unfortunately, the preference for commercial 
 items and services has eroded in practice over time despite the many statutory and regulatory 
 directives that tell the government to seek commercial items and services first. ",0.6653851881901053,61,3
2427," Suppliers of 
 commercial items are discouraged when the Department pressures suppliers to relinquish rights 
 in data for less than its value to remain competitive in a procurement. ",0.5858213835238376,61,2
2428," Inappropriate demands for 
 cost or pricing data and hard to flow down mandatory flow-down clauses also discourage 
 companies who sell in the commercial marketplace from entering the DoD market. ",0.8797273295252621,61,2
2429," 
  
 To fully maximize innovation, technical superiority, and the low cost of commercial items, we 
 recommend that the Department review and eliminate many of the barriers to commercial item 
 acquisition identified in the attached spreadsheet that have crept into the procurement process. ",1.1266648045677063,61,3
2430," 
  
 Constraints on Competition  
  
 In order to encourage more competition in federal acquisitions, we need to find ways to reduce 
 barriers to entering and staying in the defense market. ",0.9003238651398392,61,12
2431,"Many companies find it hard to maintain 
 the supply chain they once had because subcontractors and suppliers are unwilling to accept 
 stricter flow-down terms and conditions or compliances requirements unique to the federal 
 market. ",0.741322695864729,61,1
2432,"Those that do have higher costs are often not selected for award because they cannot 
 compete in a lowest-price, technically acceptable environment. ",0.8696879457663175,61,6
2433,"This is degrading the 
 Department’s ability to gain the most innovative technologies and services available because 
 many companies cannot afford or do not support a business model that requires a separate 
 supply chain or manufacturing process. ",0.9171677022965037,61,7
2434," Commercial item suppliers are thus dis-incentivized from 
 entering or remaining in the government market by the Department’s policies, some of which are 
 identified in the attached spreadsheet. ",0.654354366643894,61,6
2435,"
   
 Competitive constraints also include those regulations/policies that make it more expensive for a 
 contractor to participate in the defense marketplace. ",0.9238878302180936,61,3
2436,"  For instance, by increasing bid and proposal 
 costs through the “only one offer” provisions, the government can limit a company’s proposal 
 options when a second proposal is required to compete. ",1.0194250588852771,61,9
2437," Another example is the transfer of 
 additional competitive risk to contractors with the hopes of getting more technical data and the 
 associated rights thereto in proposals. ",0.730336764273609,61,6
2438," This has the potential to increase the contractor’s costs of 
 performance without necessarily increasing the selling price. ",1.2472445060817114,61,6
2439," 
  
 To encourage more competition in federal acquisitions, government must reduce its barriers to entry 
 into the defense market place and seek policies that will enable companies to help government agencies 
 fulfill their requirements. ",0.9505701666902961,61,7
2440," This must be balanced with the government’s need to obtain product that is 
 free of sabotage, works as intended and is sold at a reasonable price to the government. ",0.8026929587038965,61,9
2441," 
  
 3 
  
 Finally, many of today’s cost and compliance challenges are rooted in the need for a better equipped 
 defense acquisition workforce. ",0.8790463821362392,61,10
2442,"Prescriptive regulatory guidance is an inadequate substitute to address 
 these workforce issues. ",0.7987175908173799,62,11
2443,"Among other things, the workforce should be encouraged to use all the 
 flexibilities provided in the FAR and DFARS, be creative in seeking win-win solutions, and incentivized to 
 apply their business acumen and discretion to make balanced financial decisions without fear of being 
 reprimanded. ",0.9359408581345625,62,12
2444, This is the message of Better Buying Power 2.0. ,0.4456944830874936,62,10
2445,"CODSIA is committed to partnering with 
 the Department to address these workforce issues and, among other things, strongly encourage the use 
 of inter- and intra-departmental rotations, safe harbors for contracting officials implementing innovative 
 contract source decisions, mandatory professional exchanges with industry, highly competitive career 
 paths, pilot use of reduced rule and compliance regimes, and enhanced training programs that extend 
 the practice beyond the classroom. ",1.1607615895733843,62,7
2446," 
  
 Conclusion 
 Thank you again for the opportunity to respond to this request for information and share our 
 viewpoints. ",0.822662704170208,62,0
2447,"We look forward to working with the Department as you continue to analyze the response 
 you receive from this request, and we are available at any time to elaborate on our response and work 
 with the Department to develop alternative approaches. ",1.0141901398131279,62,5
2448," CODSIA further recommends that the 
 Department leverage DIB contractors and trade association personnel by creating a group that involves 
 acquisition subject matter experts and that meets on an ongoing basis to exchange ideas and solutions 
 to reduce cost and identify cost drivers in a positive environment 
  
 The attached spreadsheet identifies a number of issues. ",1.180773153772437,62,7
2449, You will see some duplication. ,0.28871127036348254,62,0

 important to allow each of the seven CODSIA associations to express their individual views of the 
 regulatory burden from the perspective of the industry they represent. ",0.5535824497116076,62,5

 While not yet implemented in regulation, there are two FAR Cases  and two DFARS Cases in 
 preparation to address the CEPA legislation. ",1.0186967229585435,64,9

 contractually impose pre-regulatory CEPA measures, such as customized Statement of Work 
 (SOW) requirements, special clauses, or invocation of various related standards (e.g., SAE) that 
 have not yet been fully endorsed by industry, which increases costs and may even conflict with 
 imminent regulation designed to properly address CEPA concerns. ",1.059411747087148,64,3
2457,"In addition, the proposed rule 
 for DFARS Case 2012-D055 anticipates linking the oversight of a contractor's CEPA plans and

 negation of the commerciality of the subject product and thereby requiring the contractor to 
 produce cost or pricing data. ",1.0382153933592277,64,6

 Commercial Items:
 Over the years since FAR Part 12 was initially revised to replace Part 11 for Acquisition of 
 Commercial Items according to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA), there 
 have been a steady increase of USG/DoD-unique clauses and requirements that have been levied 
 upon contracts and subcontracts for commercial items and services. ",0.9875754710517766,65,3
2485,"As a result, the cost of 
 commercial goods has risen for those companies willing to accept such terms, or has discouraged 
 commercial firms from doing business with the USG/DoD. ",0.7390238076202419,65,2
2486,"These additional clauses and 
 requirements also infer adverse intellectual property and/or data rights provisions will be 
 applied.",0.6770618663075553,65,9
2487,"
 Review all USG-unique and DoD-unique requirements applicable to commercial items, such as 
 domestic sourcing requirements, intellectual property rights, Item Unique Identification (IUID), 
 services manpower reporting, numerous FAR and DFARS clauses, etc., to determine whether the 
 Govt's preference for use of commercial items is better served by eliminating such barriers to 
 commercial firms doing business with DoD. Also consider the costs versus benefits of such 
 requirements on other than commercial items, particularly in a constrained budget environment. ",1.1871111675235724,65,3

 MIL-Q-9858 was identified in the Coopers & Lybrand/TASC study of DoD premium costs as the 
 number one driver of cost premium. ",1.208232894534047,65,9
2490,"While much was done to migrate from MIL-unique to 
 industry standards such as ISO-9000-based contract requirements, various DCMA actions have 
 seriously undermined the potential cost savings. ",0.9276467749304426,65,3
2491,"These include:
 (a) partially duplicating the oversight of contractor quality management systems (QMS) 
 conducted by ISO accredited third-party auditors, sometimes invoking the ""Inspection"" clause in 
 a way that apparently overrides the ""Higher Level Contract Quality Requirements"" clause; (b) 
 invoking the ""Inspection"" clause to impose increased Critical Safety Item (CSI) oversight on parts

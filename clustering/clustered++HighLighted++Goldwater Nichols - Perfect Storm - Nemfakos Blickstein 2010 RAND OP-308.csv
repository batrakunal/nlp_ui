 Preface
 In 1986, beginning with the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act, 
 the U.S. military establishment underwent the most sweeping set of defense reforms to be 
 enacted in almost 40 years. ",0.9734488123571738,4,10
42,"Related reforms followed shortly thereafter and included those 
 contained in the National Defense Authorization Act of 1987, which reflected many of the 
 recommendations of the Packard Commission. ",1.184432363239025,5,10
43,"1  In the more than two decades since that time 
 of change, the military establishment has taken numerous steps to implement the legislation’s 
 reforms and other reforms contained in commission recommendations and further legisla-
 tion. ",1.151164779723835,5,9
44,"Although reform was necessary, some within the military services have grown increas-
 ingly concerned about some of the effects, perceiving a growing divide between a military-run 
 requirements process and a civilian-run acquisition process—a divide they regard as inimical 
 to the efficient and effective support of military forces.",0.8171201972467631,5,9
45,"
 This paper focuses on the implementation of the Goldwater-Nichols Act in the Depart-
 ment of the Navy and on related acquisition reforms, but it also assesses the influence of several 
 other factors that, in large part, made passage of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation possible, 
 colored its implementation, and complicated the adoption of common-sense changes during 
 the implementation process.",1.1172919782512385,5,7
46,"
 To thoroughly examine both specific issues and general conditions, ",0.7189851254493201,5,7
47,"the RAND Corpora-
 tion undertook both objective research and an interview process that engaged former officials 
 who served during the initial enactment of the Goldwater-Nichols and acquisition reform leg-
 islation. ",0.7367531915374603,5,10
48,"The two principal authors of this paper were senior officials within the Department of 
 the Navy (DoN) during the implementation of the sweeping changes resulting from the vari-
 ous acts, they participated personally in the promulgation of many applicable internal DoN 
 regulations, and they were familiar with the principal actors on the scene during the mid- to 
 late 1980s and early 1990s. ",0.8010181184534365,5,6
49,"Their knowledge and insight has enabled the interweaving of the 
 research and interview processes. ",0.5021788991811198,5,7
50,"We attempt to highlight where objective research and inter-
 views and personal insights are the predominant basis for comments and observations. ",0.6180963579333303,5,0
51,"When 
 not otherwise indicated, the paper is informed by all three.
 ",0.3530088838681449,5,0
52,"Because of the nature of the convergent issues and the approach taken by the authors, 
 the paper should be of interest to the Department of Defense–wide acquisition community, 
 requirements-generating offices in the three military departments, students of large public 
 policy shifts in defense in the 1980s and 1990s, and members of the U.S. Congress.",0.8388366900252386,5,9

 Summary
 The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act passed in 1986 was one 
 of the most sweeping pieces of legislation to affect the Department of Defense and the mili-
 tary services in decades. ",0.6428396071140162,10,10
191,"Its passage resulted from dissatisfaction on the part of Congress and 
 other influential policymakers with what they perceived as the U.S. military’s stubborn refusal 
 to deal with long-festering problems. ",0.5496319855212878,11,0
192,"These problems included an inability on the part of the 
 military services to mount effective joint operations and an inefficient, unwieldy, and at times 
 corrupt system for acquiring weapon systems. ",0.733367084555089,11,9
193,These perceptions had some basis in reality. ,0.3558550264489463,11,0
194,"The 
 historical landscape was littered with examples of mishandled military operations, including 
 the Vietnam War and the failed attempts to rescue both the crew of the SS  Mayaguez  and the 
 Americans taken hostage in Iran. ",0.633592284478639,11,4
195,"The acquisition process fared no better in terms of success, 
 as proven by the Ill Wind investigation, huge cost overruns, and such flawed systems as the 
 A-12 Avenger.
 ",0.8253141362558281,11,0
196,"But Goldwater-Nichols was only one manifestation of widespread discontent with the 
 Department of Defense’s operational and acquisition capabilities. ",0.5671622988684771,11,9
197,"Between 1986 and 1990, a 
 remarkable number of events changed how the department was organized, conducted military 
 operations, and did business. ",0.9069054090002324,11,9
198,"The climate surrounding the enactment of Goldwater-Nichols 
 was indeed a “perfect storm,” a confluence of disparate currents, some flowing from long-
 standing problems and others from more-recent events. ",0.5073403325376649,11,0
199,"These currents not only facilitated the 
 passage of Goldwater-Nichols but also shaped its implementation in the military departments.",0.5532148676525137,11,9
200,"
 This paper focuses on the implementation of Goldwater-Nichols in DoN. ",0.8538585874703659,11,2
201,"It argues that 
 the implementation of the act in DoN had three undesirable consequences:
 • It erected an impenetrable wall between a military-controlled requirements process and a 
 civilian-driven acquisition process to the overall detriment of acquisition in DoN.
 • ",0.8102707430224941,11,9
202,"Its personnel policies deprived the DoN of a blended acquisition workforce composed of 
 line officers with extensive operational experience who provided valuable perspective that 
 those who spent most of their careers in acquisition assignments lacked.",0.6820621637347102,11,9
203,"
 • It created a generation of line officers who had little or no understanding of or apprecia-
 tion for the acquisition process.",0.4238763217422153,11,7
204,"
 These consequences were unintended by those who crafted the legislation but were exacerbated 
 by DoN’s overly restrictive interpretation of the legislation.",0.43842042126568603,11,0
205,"
 xii    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 To rectify the situation, we recommend that DoN
 • change its directives to eliminate the wall between the requirements and acquisition pro-
 cesses and spell out a continuing role for the Chief of Naval Operations and the Com-
 mandant of the Marine Corps that is more in line with the practices of the other military 
 services
 • create an acquisition oversight body co-chaired by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
 for Research, Development and Acquisition; the Vice Chief of Naval Operations; and, 
 in matters of priority interest to the Marine Corps, the Assistant Commandant of the 
 Marine Corps
 • create desirable career opportunities for line officers in the material establishment.",1.228819452107556,11,5
206,"
 In the final analysis, institutional balance is a central element of concern. ",0.595007830592013,12,7
207,"Violent storms 
 disturb the evolved balance of nature, with that equilibrium being restored over time. ",0.44980956178075315,12,0
208,"The 
 authors observe that the “perfect storm” addressed in this paper distorted the balance of actors 
 and forces that was key to institutional governance. ",0.5029283926429514,12,7
209,"A quarter of a century later, that balance 
 has not been regained; if anything, distortions continue. ",0.516615427939399,12,0
210,"The recommendations are a step in 
 restoring that institutional balance.",0.7316566225277511,12,7

 CHAPTER ONE
 Introduction
 The debate over the appropriate roles of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and of the Sec-
 retary of the Navy (SECNAV) in the material management process stretches back to the Civil 
 War era. ",1.4213343987770424,14,3
224,"1  The essence of the debate is the role of uniformed leadership (i.e., CNO) compared 
 with that of civilian leadership (i.e., SECNAV) in determining what warfighting capabilities 
 are required, what systems will be procured to provide these capabilities, how these systems 
 will be supported when introduced into the fleet, and how these systems will be funded. ",1.0139452700071994,17,9
225,"
 In 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act (P.L. 99-433) 
 weighed in on these roles as a key element in its overall reform of defense organization and 
 processes, giving responsibility for defense acquisitions to civilian secretaries while strengthen-
 ing joint uniformed oversight over the requirements process.",0.9982573590471293,17,3
226,"
 Since the enactment of this momentous legislation, the military services have taken 
 numerous steps to implement its provisions and to respond to related acquisition reforms. ",0.9120059473086134,17,9
227,"
 However, some senior Navy officials have grown increasingly concerned about the unintended 
 consequences of these reforms, perceiving a growing divide between a military-run require-
 ments process and a civilian-run acquisition process.",0.7764996808381854,17,9
228,"
 Objectives and Approaches
 RAND examined (1) the operational, budgetary, and policy issues that drove the passage of 
 the Goldwater-Nichols Act and related acquisition reforms and (2) the Department of the 
 Navy’s (DoN’s) implementation of these reforms, particularly with regard to their influence on 
 military and civilian roles in the DoN’s acquisition process. ",1.0836274262081143,17,9
229,"This paper describes the context 
 in which acquisition reform occurred and the effects of that reform on acquisition processes, 
 focusing largely on DoN. Drawing on a series of interviews with numerous officials who were 
 present when the legislation was implemented, we conclude that the reform’s effect was to focus 
 the CNO’s attention on requirements issues and to divorce the position from the acquisition 
 process in a way that has been detrimental to the effective and efficient acquisition of material 
 for DoN. It further argues that this separation went beyond what the legislation required and 
 that there needs to be closer integration of CNO’s interests with those of the Assistant Sec-
 retary of the Navy (ASN) for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASN (RD&A)) and

 CHAPTER TWO
 The Context of Goldwater-Nichols
 The passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1986 resulted from operational, organizational, 
 and fiscal pressures that had been building for a number of years and, indeed, continued after 
 the act was passed. ",0.919968230291085,19,7
252,"These pre- and postenactment events are important because they provide 
 the context in which legislation was passed and implemented in DoD and the military services. ",0.8443637033106972,20,9

 passage, and implementation of the legislation.",0.6675329729352691,20,7

 of Goldwater-Nichols. ",0.4081749572942356,20,0
255,The timeline underscores several points. ,0.33191092668679995,20,0
256,"First, the forces that eventually 
 called Goldwater-Nichols into being began to arise in the decades before the act was passed. ",0.5810954341493378,20,0
257,"
 Second, these forces manifested themselves in quite different venues: in the operational perfor-
 mance of U.S. military forces, in the performance of the system that governed the acquisition 
 of military weapons and weapon systems, and in the behavior and practices of those who oper-
 ated in that system. ",0.7677888655554502,20,7
258,"Third, a remarkable number of important events that occurred between 
 1985 and 1990 built an almost unstoppable momentum that ensured that long-standing issues 
 would finally be dealt with in a systematic way. ",0.739856923785175,20,0
259,"The effect of the whole far exceeded the power 
 of the individual parts. ",0.47415877388182304,20,0
260,"The following sections briefly describe the events that contributed to 
 the eventual perfect storm.",0.6001475315023869,20,7
261,"
 Operational Shortcomings
 A series of either failed or less-than-satisfactory military operations sparked among policymakers 
 widespread discontent with the performance of the U.S. military. ",0.6641555929397256,20,7
262,"Further fueling that discon-
 tent was the fact that the problems appeared to be systemic and not simply the failure of any 
 particular set of individuals. ",0.6116317322825857,20,0
263,"After-action reports called attention to, among other things, the 
 failure of the military services to work together as a harmonious whole. ",0.6809040602939346,20,7
264,"The problem persisted, 
 and policymakers eventually lost faith in the will or the ability of the military services to over-
 come service parochialism in the interest of developing joint capabilities.",0.7418045801703769,20,7

 In May 1975, two weeks after the fall of Saigon to the forces of North Vietnam, the Khmer 
 Rouge government of Cambodia seized a U.S. container ship, the SS  Mayaguez , in inter-
 national waters (that Cambodia claimed as its own) and removed the crew for questioning. ",0.6006423581460073,22,4
276,"
 Having just suffered the ignominy of defeat in Vietnam, the United States felt the need to 
 make a decisive statement and opted to stage a military rescue of the crew. ",0.6521521046263985,22,0
277,"The ensuing opera-
 tion involved Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force elements along with various intelligence 
 agencies. ",0.6399749042074462,22,3
278,"The central operational action was an assault on an island off the coast of Cambo-
 dia where the United States thought the crew was being held captive. ",0.590428202429818,22,4
279,"In reality, however, the 
 crew had been released before the operation began, and the island had been heavily fortified 
 for reasons that had nothing to do with the SS  Mayaguez . ",0.43903892348143264,22,4
280,"Intelligence agencies failed to detect 
 the fortifications. ",0.4086043048212582,22,0
281,"The rescue operation was a debacle that resulted in approximately 20 killed 
 and 40 wounded U.S. personnel. ",0.48976939261161284,22,4
282,"Exacerbating this unsought outcome was the fact that several 
 of the service members’ bodies were not retrieved and that three marines were left behind to 
 be captured, tortured, and eventually killed. ",0.5247587003603364,22,0
283,"The U.S. military was criticized for faulty intel-
 ligence, coordination and communications problems, and the ad hoc and haphazard planning 
 of the joint operation. ",0.7465972605310619,22,9
284,"3
 Lebanon
 Poor communication and unclear chains of command were similarly highlighted in analyses 
 of the United States’ involvement in a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon during 
 the early 1980s. ",0.717202481549438,22,9
285,"4  One analysis determined that six command chains controlled the actions of 
 the marine amphibious unit deployed in Lebanon and that this led to communication break-
 downs and unclear authority. ",0.7485060514118919,22,8
286,"5  Political and military leaders also frequently changed the rules 
 of engagement during the two years when military forces were involved, leading to inconsisten-
 cies that may have created an atmosphere of hesitancy among marines that contributed to the 
 death of 275 marines in a suicide bombing.",0.6949542404806415,22,0

 Grenada and Operation Urgent Fury
 In 1983, when U.S. forces invaded the island of Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury (an 
 effort to oust the Cuban-sponsored People’s Revolutionary Government and to protect U.S. 
 citizens on the southern Caribbean island), the same issues and operational failures arose: 
 Poor communications, command and control, and planning diminished operational efficiency, 
 despite the efforts of the troops on the ground. ",0.9474823889111751,22,0
288,"6  For example, different force components—
 including rangers, paratroopers, sailors, and marines—lacked interoperable communication 
 devices, and key players were excluded from planning, which led to problems with logistics

 The Holloway Report, which reported the results of a review of Operation Eagle Claw 
 and was conducted for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and led by former CNO Admiral James 
  Holloway III, directed much of its criticism for the failed hostage rescue mission toward the 
 lack of joint training and coordination; the lack of integrated intelligence for use by the joint 
 task force; overly complex, service-unique planning by each military service; and communica-
 tion deficiencies. ",1.2054745223514671,23,3

 Summary of Military Operational Deﬁciencies
 This failed rescue attempt examined in the Holloway Report is a microcosm of all the problems 
 encountered in what seemed to be an unending series of military disasters that shared simi-
 lar shortcomings: muddled and multiple chains of command, poor interservice planning and 
 coordination, ad hoc responses to each new crisis, the inability of one service to communicate 
 with another, and interservice rivalries and parochialism that hampered the services’ ability to 
 work in concert. ",0.8371905612028231,23,7

 Poor Outcomes

 Budget Shortfalls
 The economic recession inherited by President Reagan and the tax reductions and dramatic 
 defense spending increases he initiated during the first half of the 1980s led to the largest 
 budget deficits in peacetime history. ",0.7367579798097235,25,0

 1990s and peaked after the fall of the Berlin Wall. ",0.5297280123017747,25,0

 liberals in the executive and legislative branches of government. ",0.8446936731710052,25,9

 Under the GRH ceiling structure, defense suffered disproportionately because much of 
 the federal domestic program budget, particularly that covering Social Security and Medicare, 
 was procedurally exempt from the act’s provisions. ",0.8533793008635123,25,10

361,"These 
 programs were particularly vulnerable because moving them into planned full-scale produc-
 tion levels required billions in additional appropriations. ",0.7629273884023466,26,7
362,"As could be expected, the spreading 
 awareness of the impending defense program budget cuts and the continued pressure by Con-
 gress to reduce spending motivated various DoD-wide efforts to curtail costs. ",1.0099026306456538,26,9

 a reduction in the federal workforce, including the number of civil servants involved in the 
 defense acquisition process. ",0.8518209792104992,26,9

 gress took place in the late 1980s. ",0.5221980290609234,26,0

 spending in the mid- and late 1980s drastically affected the development and approval of the 
 department’s program priorities, and their influences are still felt today. ",0.7693365185688861,26,9
368,"The adjustments were
 • the general pressure to make arbitrary reductions in labor and material costs in defense 
 procurement, which established a new costing baseline

 CHAPTER THREE
 The Goldwater-Nichols Act and the National Defense 
 Authorization Act of 1987
 This chapter briefly describes the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act, the main players in its 
 enactment, and its key provisions. ",0.749132411400045,27,10
380,It also discusses the NDAA.,0.38412180249888184,28,2
381,"
 Key Players
 In 1985, Senators Samuel Nunn and Barry Goldwater brought many of the issues described in 
 Chapter Two to the attention of the Congress in a series of energetic floor speeches designed 
 to garner political support for reform. ",0.796724954691003,28,10
382,"For example, an interesting and important perspective 
 on staff roles was articulated in views expressed by Senator Goldwater, who, in Senate floor 
 speeches, also addressed what he perceived as the misguided financial focus of the military:
 A second consequence of this preoccupation with trying to find resources is that the mili-
 tary services are becoming more oriented toward business management than toward plan-
 ning for and fighting a war. ",0.8880610925115946,28,9
383,"Our professional officer corps frequently behaves more like 
 business managers than warriors. ",0.48018314833436065,28,8
384,"1
 Senator Nunn also expounded on the issue of civilian control in the military establishment:
 [A] major problem created by the functional structure of OSD is that it encourages micro-
 management of Service programs .",1.0097436948550633,28,3

 details that could be better managed by the Services. ",0.7949380832907725,28,9
388,"2
 In addition, two of Senator Nunn’s major points harkened back to earlier reports on military 
 operations:
 First, there was the lack of true unity of command, and second, there was inadequate ",0.5514848128383154,28,9

 14    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 Senators Nunn and Goldwater together wrote on the issue of structural alignment:
 The Office of the Secretary of Defense is focused exclusively on functional areas, such as 
 manpower, research and development, and installations and logistics. ",0.9897466463998092,28,3
397,"This functional struc-
 ture serves to inhibit integration of Service capabilities along mission lines, and thereby, 
 hinders achieving DoD’s principal organization goal of mission integration. ",0.7125712207120103,29,9
398,"4
 Representative William F. Nichols from the House of Representatives joined Senators Nunn 
 and Goldwater in their efforts.",0.5106106793942602,29,10
399,"
 Key Provisions of Goldwater-Nichols
 Senators Nunn and Goldwater led the effort to draft the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which was 
 signed into law in 1986. ",0.7794937316691049,29,10
400,"The act made major changes in four broad areas: the chain of com-
 mand and provision of military advice to the civilian leadership, the interaction of the military 
 services, the personnel management of officers, and the acquisition of military equipment. ",0.9422194805480828,29,5
401,"The 
 bill passed with wide bipartisan support: The House of Representatives vote was 383–27; the 
 Senate’s was 95–0. ",0.47100448701370123,29,10
402,"The act was signed into law by President Reagan on October 1, 1986. ",0.6773679382249276,29,10
403,"5
 Each of the several key aspects of Goldwater-Nichols addressed in the following sections 
 had important ramifications for DoD writ large, but their implementation in DoN had conse-
 quences whose effects were not fully understood at the time and, as is more fully discussed in 
 Chapter Five, were likely not intended. ",0.914706192067704,29,7
404,"The first two aspects served to disorient, and the latter 
 two served to disenfranchise.",0.3537890219991022,29,2
405,"
 The Chain of Command and the Provision of Military Advice to the Civilian Leadership
 In a key provision of the act, the process of delivering military advice to civilian authority 
 was streamlined, and the function was centralized in the person of the Chairman of the Joint 
 Chiefs of Staff, who became the principal military advisor to the President, the National Secu-
 rity Council, and the Secretary of Defense. ",0.9554461870342421,29,3
406,"Previously, the chiefs of the individual services had 
 performed many associated roles; the CNO, for example, had been the advisor to the President 
 for naval matters. ",0.7607666585308092,29,5
407,"The act also established the position of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
 of Staff, increased the ability of the Chairman to direct overall strategy, and provided greater 
 command authority to “unified” and “specified” field commanders. ",1.1651106395611146,29,5
408,"6
 Interaction Among the Military Services
 The act affected service interactions by (1) diminishing the role of the service chiefs and 
 (2) restricting the military services’ operational control over forces, emphasizing instead their 
 responsibility to support the military department secretaries in their Title 10 role to organize, 
 train, and equip military forces for use by the Commanders-in-Chief (CINCs). ",1.1349678984099,29,5

 thus became “force providers” to the unified commanders, and their mission was to provide 
 to the CINCs the suitably trained and equipped forces that the CINCs requested through the 
 Joint Staff. ",1.0570699374520762,30,3
416,"Regardless of his service, the CINC had authority to request assets from any service 
 through the joint system. ",0.6608933929111609,30,8
417,"7
 These two changes unraveled relationships that, at least within DoN, had developed and 
 evolved for more than 50 years. ",0.7882532097927263,30,7
418,"That is not to say that change is impermissible, but, in this 
 case, there was no clear sense of the nature of the new role to be played by the service chiefs; 
 rather, they were instructed what not to do.",0.6597867468134541,30,7
419,"
 The Management of Ofﬁcers
 Another significant but more subtle change was the direction that an officer could not receive 
 promotion to flag rank without having completed a joint duty assignment. ",0.6941682826970655,30,8
420,"8  Underlying this 
 requirement was the perception on the part of lawmakers that the services were reluctant to 
 send their best officers to joint duty assignments, preferring to keep them in their own ranks. ",0.5829699180919253,30,8
421,"
 Indeed, a joint duty assignment was perceived by many Navy officers as a backwater and 
 an indication that an individual’s military career was not progressing well. ",0.4916378133834472,30,8
422,"Officers resisted 
 going to such assignments and, if assigned to a joint billet, tried to leave them as soon as they 
 could. ",0.5044835088533529,30,8
423,"Stipulating that promotion to flag rank could not occur without a joint duty assign-
 ment ensured that the services would assign their best officers to such billets, willing or not, as 
 a matter of necessity.",0.6082368007421789,30,8
424,"
 The Acquisition of Military Equipment
 The Goldwater-Nichols Act specifically addressed acquisition issues, giving sole responsibility 
 for acquisition (as part of the assignment of several “functional” areas of responsibility) to the 
 Secretary of each military department. ",0.8398992622383374,30,5
425,"For example, as it pertained to DoN, Section 5014 of 
 the act stated:
 (C) (1) The Office of the Secretary of the Navy shall have sole responsibility within the 
 Office of the Secretary of the Navy, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and the 
 Headquarters, Marine Corps, for the following functions:
 • Acquisition
 • Auditing
 • Comptroller (including financial management)",0.9731554875640438,30,3
426,"
 • Information management
 • Legislative affairs
 • Public affairs. ",0.4932159538546308,30,10
427,"9
 7  CINC (or, as they are now called, Combatant Commander) requests go to the Joint Staff, which then coordinates the 
 delivery of requested assets with the relevant service. ",1.012051221758007,30,5
428,"Requests are not automatically approved, however. ",0.6657081816420393,30,4
429,"For example, when 
 Commander-in-Chief, U.S. European Command, requested Apache helicopters during the military operations in Kosovo 
 designed to topple Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, the four services did not concur with the request. ",0.7490945368906979,30,1
430,"After pass-
 ing out of the joint arena, the request was ultimately approved by the Secretary of Defense. ",0.6188354255285854,30,1

 ing these ranks are authorized a flag whose number of stars denotes the specific rank (e.g., a brigadier general’s flag has one

 16    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 Unlike in the other military departments, in DoN, many of these functional responsibilities 
 were already being performed by elements of the secretariat. ",0.8098581060615448,30,6
435,"The word “sole” contributed to the 
 view that the service chief was excluded from the process entirely. ",0.48168143307370354,31,2
436,"The act further stipulated 
 that the Secretary designate a single organization—a service acquisition executive (SAE)—
 within the Secretary’s office to manage the function of acquisition.",0.718206795070227,31,5
437,"
 It is noteworthy that, even after the legislative changes had been passed, Senator Nunn 
 continued to reflect on the balance of service and civilian command and control. ",0.8465426322379596,31,2
438,"Relevant to 
 our investigation of the role of the CNO is Senator Nunn’s concern over barriers between the 
 military department secretary and the service chief:
 Another area that was of concern is in the consolidation of the military and civilian staffs 
 in the military departments. ",0.5968365094698443,31,3
439,"The conference agreed to consolidate several functions, such 
 as acquisition, comptroller, inspector general, and legislative liaison, under the Secretar-
 ies of the military departments and directed that the service chiefs not set up competing 
 bureaucracies within their staffs. ",0.7986371956807796,31,3
440,"In the conference,  I was concerned that we not create an 
 impenetrable wall between the staffs of the Service Secretary and the Service Chief . ",0.490192311208237,31,1

 The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987
 The NDAA attempted to deal with several policy concerns not addressed by the Goldwater-
 Nichols Act. ",0.8252581204566474,31,10
443,"For example, it addressed the project office workload problem as represented by 
 the excessive number of briefings that program managers (PMs) were required to give to get 
 program approval, decreasing them to two: one to the program executive officer (PEO) and 
 one to either the defense acquisition executive (DAE) or the SAE (depending upon the acquisi-
 tion approval threshold of the program). ",0.9080630449003321,31,6

 chain from PMs to PEOs to the SAE. ",0.5869735286732523,31,6

 CHAPTER FOUR
 Acquisition Before and After Goldwater-Nichols
 This chapter lays out the acquisition processes before and after the perfect storm described in 
 the previous chapter. ",0.4944896789003914,31,7
456,"For convenience, the Goldwater-Nichols Act is referred to as the break-
 point, but we acknowledge that multiple influences led to a series of what might be described as 
 tectonic shifts in acquisition processes. ",0.6282109623909171,32,7
457,"Furthermore, although Goldwater-Nichols was passed 
 into law at a specific point in time, not all of its effects (or those of the other elements of the 
 perfect storm) were felt immediately. ",0.617487349937638,32,0
458,"It was several years before some of the effects were codi-
 fied in DoD or defense component regulations or implemented by the Services.",0.6128292769386517,32,9
459,"
 ",0.0,32,-1
460,"This paper focuses primarily on the Navy, but we also discuss changes that occurred in 
 the Army and the Air Force because, in some instances, those services responded to the leg-
 islation in ways that differed from the Navy, and those differences are illuminating. ",0.6865720252219869,32,7
461,"(Note 
 that Marine Corps acquisition processes fall under the same DoN regulations that govern the 
 Navy’s.) ",0.41007799895953584,32,1
462,"In the following sections, we briefly describe the processes at the DoD level and then 
 within the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. ",0.6923898882920593,32,3
463,"Our discussion of the three services is guided 
 by changes in service acquisition regulations, which are summarized in a table for each service.",0.8528936326265043,32,9
464,"
 The Ofﬁce of the Secretary of Defense
 Before the implementation of acquisition reforms passed in the late 1980s, and before the 
 resulting streamlining that occurred, each military department had an acquisition ",0.800048940948188,32,10
465,"organiza-
 tion that, relative to later years, included more stakeholders and more steps in the acquisition 
 process. ",0.6346776357190371,32,7
466,"Most of the functions that now reside with the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisi-
 tion, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) were at that time assigned to the Undersecre-
 tary of Defense for Research and Engineering. ",0.6753202677749598,32,3
467,"Before 1986, the Secretary of Defense had over-
 all responsibility for DoD acquisition. ",0.4225317635633052,32,3
468,"The Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of 
 Defense presided over milestone decisions that are similar to those now overseen by the DAE. ",0.5234777890348403,32,3
469,"
 The most-significant change to the DoD-level acquisition regulations after Goldwater-Nichols 
 was that many of the Secretary of Defense’s acquisition decision authorities were delegated to 
 the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition (USD (A)). ",0.7132568963943668,32,3
470,"Most significantly, the USD (A) 
 was designated as the DAE and thus “the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on 
 all matters pertaining to the Department of Defense Acquisition System.” ",0.5415295800355253,32,3
471,"1  Before 1987, the 
 Deputy Secretary of Defense and various under secretaries (Research and Engineering, Policy), 
 assistant secretaries (Acquisition and Logistics; Force Management and Personnel; Command, 
 1  DoDD 5000.1.",0.8404316294308927,32,3
472,"
 18    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 Control, Communications, and Intelligence; and Comptroller), and the Director, Operational 
 Test and Evaluation, were responsible for different aspects of the acquisition process. ",0.9839047574451066,32,5
473,"Fur-
 ther, in response to the NDAA, DoDD 5000.1 (1986) restricted the number of “management 
 layers” between the PM and the DAE to two: the PEO and the SAE.",0.6579849435623678,33,1
474,"
 The Navy
 Navy History and Culture
 Each service has its own history and culture, and these profoundly influence how the services 
 operate. ",0.4750608156923596,33,9
475,"In the case of the Navy, one of the signal differences between it and the other services 
 appears in the very titles of the chiefs of service. ",0.4420193985351895,33,2
476,"Both the Army and the Air Force are headed 
 by an individual designated as the Chief of Staff—someone who oversees the workings of a 
 staff and is a staff officer. ",0.6590213145179987,33,1
477,"The head of the Navy, however, is designated CNO, which implies an 
 individual with operational command; indeed, this aspect of CNO’s office is deeply embedded 
 in Navy history and practice. ",0.5613763288512806,33,1
478,"Of these service chiefs, only CNO has ever both been heavily 
 involved in service operational matters and ultimately served as the principal advisor to the 
 President on such matters. ",0.6827871682405597,33,1
479,"The point is that, historically, CNO focused on operational matters.",0.5285420685640838,33,6
480,"
 Until 1966, the Navy was often informally characterized as “bilinear” because CNO 
 focused on the Navy’s operational issues while SECNAV was wholly responsible for the mate-
 rial component, including research and acquisition elements. ",0.8273893469696606,33,3
481,"The tension between the mili-
 tary and civilian leadership of DoN over material matters was longstanding, and, historically, 
 CNOs pushed for a greater role in acquisition matters (some even lobbied the President). ",0.6532204495327237,33,9
482,"2  
 Organizationally, the chiefs of the Navy’s material bureaus reported to the SECNAV for all 
 material matters. ",0.5113159595752441,33,1
483,"In 1966, the SECNAV established the Navy Materiel Command (NMC), 
 which was commanded by a four-star admiral with extensive operational experience and who 
 reported to CNO. ",0.7120605007863628,33,1
484,"This was a major change (akin to the later tectonic shifts alluded to earlier) 
 because it placed CNO directly in the line of material—including acquisition—issues. ",0.8355229809901392,33,7
485,"What 
 was bilinear had become unilinear in that now CNO, under the direction of the SECNAV, had 
 a direct role in the oversight of organizations involved in acquisition matters. ",0.9195365999267571,33,5
486,"3
 Edwin Hooper and Thomas Hone provide rich examinations of the ebb and flow of the 
 tide of control, which started with considerations that date all the way back to the Civil War. ",0.7635577981963503,33,4
487,"4  
 Current discussions about increasing the authority, or even the responsibility, of Combatant 
 Commanders simply continue the argument of who is best prepared to provide leadership in 
 the military establishment. ",1.1275970966341036,33,9
488,"Shortly after Goldwater-Nichols was passed, a former SECNAV 
 suggested that only the SECNAV could perform the role of a DoN acquisition executive 
 2  In a March 1934 memorandum to the SECNAV, President Franklin Roosevelt, himself a former Assistant Secretary of 
 the Navy, wrote,

489,In my judgment he ,0.1762943456089048,33,0

495,"By this, I mean that the Chief

 touch with the heads of bureaus and offices. ",0.5862617115784587,33,2
496,"But at the same time, the orders to Bureaus and offices should come from the 
 Secretary of the Navy. ",0.4619219680415369,33,1
497,"(Franklin Roosevelt, “Memorandum to Secretary of the Navy,” Washington, D.C., March 2, 1934)

 nizational realignment, he gained directive authority.",0.7239370102925682,33,1

 because only the SECNAV had control of resources, could provide guidance to the service 
 chiefs on plans and requirements, and had the political gravitas to engage both external and 
 internal stakeholders. ",1.0167604403392696,33,6
500,"In his September 2008 Senate testimony regarding Goldwater-Nichols, 
 Clark Murdock proposed an alignment that, decades after the legislation’s enactment, reflects 
 that same perspective. ",0.6158530676473755,34,10
501,"5
 Acquisition Changes in the Navy
 Differences in acquisition practices over time can be seen by tracing changes in Secretary of 
 the Navy Instructions (SECNAVINSTs) that pertain to acquisition. ",0.6658824558630191,34,9
502,"Table 4.1 summarizes sig-
 nificant aspects of these instructions, showing how the instructions (presented in chronological 
 sequence at the top of the table) affected different parts of the DoN organization.",0.6220990685929365,34,7
503,"
 Before the Storm
 Acquisition just before the passage of Goldwater-Nichols was governed by SECNAVINST 
 4200.29A (1985). ",0.41658247294385015,34,2
504,"The wording in that instruction made SECNAV the de facto “acquisition 
 executive” referred to in subsequent legislation and regulation. ",0.5405388376801362,34,2
505,"It recognized his decision 
 authority for acquisition matters pertaining to the Navy. ",0.48889702631991094,34,5
506,"The instruction designated ASN for 
 Shipbuilding and Logistics (ASN (S&L)) as the senior procurement executive and made him 
 responsible for the performance of systems and for managing the career acquisition workforce. ",0.8940198778481451,34,3
507,"
 He was designated as the focal point for procurement and the logistical systems necessary to 
 support the systems the Navy procured.",0.6282384079996215,34,1
508,"
 The instruction directed CNO to support ASN (S&L) in carrying out his duties. ",0.6936513026080445,34,5
509,"
 During this period, each of the three major warfare branches of the Navy—air, surface, and 
  submarine—was represented by a three-star admiral on the Office of the Chief of Naval Oper-
 ations (OPNAV) staff who had direct contact with the Systems Commanders for material 
 in his warfare area. ",0.6991669854868331,34,1
510,"Each also had program officers who maintained a liaison with the PMs 
 reporting to the Systems Commanders.",0.7407339910920511,34,8
511,"
 CNO played a direct role in the procurement process in multiple ways. ",0.646929441166617,34,9
512,"His most direct 
 role was reviewing all programs going to the SECNAV for decision. ",0.8215925289504499,34,6
513,"The mechanism for this 
 review was the CNO Executive Board (CEB), on which the Vice Chief of Naval Operations 
 also sat. ",0.6170527270920824,34,1
514,"As discussed below, the Systems Commanders reported material initiatives to CNO 
 through the CEB, giving CNO a prime opportunity to engage in material management.",0.6131481128632906,34,9
515,"
 Although the Systems Commanders reported directly to the four-star commander of 
 NMC, they also had reporting responsibilities to CNO; ASN (S&L); and ASN for Research, 
 Engineering and Systems (ASN (RE&S)) in their areas of responsibility, and they were respon-
 sible for coordinating matters through NMC. ",0.7602680717532427,34,5
516,"The three warfare-branch vice admirals on the 
 CNO’s staff did the planning and programming for their individual warfare area systems and 
 coordinated with NMC and the Systems Commands (SYSCOMs). ",0.8460928955011207,34,5
517,"Programming reviews were 
 carried out through a CNO-chartered board. ",0.63007750829144,34,1
518,"The PMs reported to the Systems Commanders 
 through the appropriate functional SYSCOM flag officers. ",0.5362766141859098,34,8

 24    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 Although the change was not codified in Navy instructions until later, in 1985, the 
 SECNAV abolished NMC—another of the tectonic shifts that occurred in Navy acquisition. ",0.9615694178130862,38,2

 The Chief of NMC was a four-star officer of the line who brought senior-level credibility to the 
 material establishment and buffered the material community when needed. ",0.741052364131351,39,8
591,"The disestablish-
 ment of NMC eliminated this buffer and permitted the eventual erosion of the operational 
 credentials of the material community and of the bona fides of its proposed decisions. ",0.7039935178689136,39,7
592,"6  It has 
 been argued that NMC’s ability to air differing perspectives was also the proximate cause of its 
 disestablishment; other causes included the fact that the organization created another manage-
 ment layer, slowed the decision process, and ran counter to the Packard Commission’s views 
 on lines of authority.",0.7301265557257727,39,7

 sition system. ",0.8316033682442283,39,1
604,"In doing so, the instruction stated that CNO and Commandant of the Marine 
 Corps (CMC) “will execute their responsibilities through the resource allocation process and 
 their input to the acquisition decision-making process.” ",0.9652662361355477,40,5
605,"8
 Implementing Goldwater-Nichols imposed important changes on the Navy’s acquisition 
 process. ",0.935166914860624,40,7
606,"In the view of a former SECNAV, the law simply allowed too much latitude in imple-
 mentation. ",0.46930058896429294,40,0
607,"For example, both a former General Counsel for the Navy and a former ASN 
 (RD&A) interpreted the provision that assigned authority for the acquisition process to the 
 military department secretaries as entirely excluding the service chiefs from the acquisition 
 process. ",0.5989167670409415,40,1
608,"However, the first CNO to operate under the new provisions said that he had been 
 unclear about his role in the acquisition process. ",0.46749068098758967,40,9
609,"He added that he had been advised not to get 
 involved in acquisition decisionmaking. ",0.5985611371949309,40,9
610,"However, feeling that he had to be involved because 
 he was being held “accountable” by Congress for acquisition failures, such as the A-12 aircraft 
 program, he ignored that advice. ",0.6993906278372014,40,9
611,"9
 Different interpretations also are reflected in the different forms that implementation 
 took among the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. ",0.6301762796919448,40,1
612,"Each of the military departments imple-
 mented the law differently, and all came under fire from the Comptroller General for various 
 reasons. ",0.5328090875323865,40,10
613,"The common theme of these attacks was the nature of the delineation of organiza-
 tional responsibilities. ",0.385188779295423,40,0
614,"For acquisition, each service had PEOs reporting to the applicable mili-
 tary SYSCOM structure. ",0.5080517062005586,40,5
615,"Following the 1989 GAO report, all military departments severed 
 the PEO structure from the SYSCOMs. ",0.7246905650093235,40,3
616,"10
 With the passage of Goldwater-Nichols, the new DoN instruction, SECNAVINST 
 5430.96 (1987), and a companion instruction, SECNAVINST 5430.95 (1987), designated 
 SECNAV as acquisition executive for the Navy. ",0.5245914138835635,40,1
617,"  Thus, he not only held program decision 
 authority but also, as acquisition executive, was responsible for the acquisition process. ",0.5878678559440436,40,6
618,"In 
 support of SECNAV in that role, ASN (S&L) reported directly to SECNAV for acquisition 
 matters. ",0.558227410734918,40,5
619,"ASN (S&L) was charged with responsibility for supplying, equipping, servicing, and 
 maintaining the Navy’s equipment. ",0.6750861425844189,40,8
620,"He had responsibility for acquisition production and sup-
 port for the Navy and the Marine Corps and for “provid[ing] such staff support as the CNO 
 and [the Commandant] each consider necessary.” ",0.8677642725146607,40,3
621,"11  SECNAVINST 5430.95, dated just one 
 day after SECNAVINST 5430.96, pertained to ASN (RE&S), who was responsible for all 
 DoN acquisition except ship construction and conversion. ",0.5579430989831153,40,1

 ters related to research and development. ",0.5993868950473219,40,6

 of Naval Research reported to ASN (RE&S). ",0.5759989798207282,40,1

 9  This CNO had to deal with the consequences of the unraveling of the A-12 program. ",0.4919981171307357,40,7
629,"In an interview for this study, he 
 expressed the view that Congress was demanding answers from him on a range of issues with regard to the A-12 replace-
 ment program and the F-18 E/F and that, given what had occurred in the A-12 program, he had to be aware and involved in 
 aspects of program decisionmaking, both to represent Navy interests and concerns before Congress and to be able to defend 
 Navy resources.",1.0329004511072841,40,7

 tize research, development, test, and evaluation; and provide advice and support to SECNAV. ",1.2616969639283362,40,6
633,"
 Thus, CNO became responsible for determining what equipment the Navy needed but not for 
 acquiring it. ",0.6848142329534567,41,6
634,That function was now located wholly in the secretariat.,0.35500519504626316,41,4

 Under the provisions of SECNAVINST 5430.96, the Systems Commanders now reported 
 to the DoN acquisition executive for all PEO matters under the direction of ASN (S&L). ",0.5234607843385326,41,1
636,"Simi-
 larly, the PEOs also reported to ASN (S&L).",0.35245195241809457,41,2

 Passage of Goldwater-Nichols did not lay to rest all acquisition issues, and all applicable

 Lehman, SECNAV from 1981 to 1987, designated himself as the acquisition executive but,

 legislation, and the Secretary of Defense and his deputy pressed DoN to designate an indi-
 vidual ASN as the acquisition executive, eventually directing DoN to make that change. ",0.793421045380398,41,1

 Summary of Key Changes in Navy Acquisition
 The process of acquiring Navy equipment changed dramatically between 1966 and 1991. ",0.8884943310761502,43,7
670,"Some 
 changes were more gradual than others. ",0.66271991964382,43,0
671,"The creation of the unilinear Navy took decades and 
 crystallized with the establishment of NMC in 1966. ",0.6239425330377758,43,2
672,"NMC’s dissolution in 1985 marked an 
 equally significant shift. ",0.3684199110588092,43,0
673,"However, most key changes occurred as part of the perfect storm of 
 events that centered on the Goldwater-Nichols legislation. ",0.7240837351780237,43,7

 directly by the Secretary of the Army or by his order. ",0.5028549035700052,44,1
685,"Before implementation of Goldwater-

 utive (AAE). ",0.6827899078784341,44,1

 ear Navy did not engage CNO immediately in the administration of the various material 
 “bureaus” that handled the acquisition and logistical functions supporting the Navy. ",1.0334428227709154,56,3
876,"Ships, 
 Ordnance, Aeronautics, and Supply and Accounts were some of the bureaus that handled such 
 functions and reported to SECNAV. ",0.49492007503611285,57,2
877,"In 1966, with the creation of the Chief of Naval Mate-
 rial, subsequent CNOs played a greater role in the management of the material establishment 
 and in its production. ",0.7041182750936209,57,7
878,"Even so, for individual CNOs who had “grown up” in the operational 
 world—and particularly those without significant Washington, D.C., experience—dealing 
 with material (including acquisition) matters was somewhat foreign. ",0.7302396887910535,57,9
879,"Furthermore, because 
 DoN includes two services, the Navy and the Marine Corps, the DoN secretariat tended to act 
 with greater scope than did the secretariats of the Army and the Air Force.",0.805848117025448,57,1
880,"
 ",0.0,57,-1
881,"The term  Chief of Staff  meant, in the Army, Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Army; 
 in the Air Force, Chief of Staff to SecAF. ",0.4178870213388405,57,1
882,"As no such office existed in DoN, its secretariat 
 was responsible for a broader set of functions that, in the other military departments, were 
 performed in the service headquarters staffs. ",0.8606658802935853,57,5
883,"A couple of examples in central departmental 
 management functions (finance and contracts) are illustrative. ",0.577766606387986,57,2
884,"First, DoN’s budget function 
 reported to the ASN for Financial Management (ASN (FM)), not to either service chief. ",0.7014907861024858,57,1
885,"In 
 its functions, that budget office exerted ecumenical control of the finances of the two DoN 
 sister services and clearly worked for SECNAV. ",0.7437240711892895,57,6
886,"In the planning and programming processes, 
 the Navy and the Marine Corps built their POM for SECNAV to approve, but the subsequent 
 budget fell under SECNAV management through ASN (FM). ",0.9801052257401666,57,1
887,"Second, contract award approv-
 als were managed by another ASN, depending on the item being procured. ",0.5841231761778695,57,2
888,"The contract award 
 justification, called the determination and findings, had to be reviewed and approved by the 
 appropriate office in the DoN secretariat before contracts were awarded, which meant that the 
 secretariat now played a major role in acquisition. ",0.8510357931978653,57,6
889,"16  Finally, the DoN secretariat was staffed 
 to perform these regulatory and statutory functions and, as a result, was larger than the other 
 military secretariats. ",0.8621236450479499,57,9
890,"For example, the ASN (FM) staff, including the Comptroller, at times 
 exceeded several hundred people.",0.760128321702704,57,1
891,"
 A second major difference between the Navy and her sister services was the manner in 
 which the staffs were structured for decisionmaking. ",0.5052590426193969,57,9
892,"The Army and the Air Force tended to 
 look upon issues through a functional lens. ",0.5962597919488273,57,9
893,"That is, when those services addressed issues, their 
 reviews occurred at the functional level of manpower, logistics, modernization, etc. ",1.0090178849914833,57,6
894,"In the 
 Navy, however, responsibility was held by three-star admirals who controlled surface, sub-
 marine, and aviation portfolios and therefore approached issues from a platform perspective. ",0.5648654651401621,57,1
895,"
 These three-star admirals also had a major voice in the requirements determination and acqui-
 sition processes before Goldwater-Nichols and had direct relationships with their three-star 
 counterparts in the Navy SYSCOMs. ",0.6249009055517883,57,8
896,"When there were issues between a statement of require-
 ments and the ability to develop acquisition programs, these issues could be resolved at the 
 three-star level. ",0.8845542021276876,57,6
897,"As the Navy moved the acquisition function more fully into the DoN secretar-
 iat concurrent with the passage of Goldwater-Nichols, it abolished those three-star billets and 
 reduced the functions they performed to the two-star level. ",0.7855061072721009,57,8
898,"This action, taken independently 
 of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, impeded the two stars’ comunications with the Systems 
 Commanders, who were ultimately removed from the acquisition chain because the new PEOs 
 16  The determinations and findings are signed, legally binding statements submitted in writing by an employee to explain 
 or justify the method and logic used to select material, services, or suppliers when committing federal, state, or district 
 funds for purposes of procurement of materials or services.",0.9895775047832835,57,7
899,"
 Acquisition Before and After Goldwater-Nichols    43
 reported directly to ASN (RD&A). ",0.4710506695738584,57,9
900,"The Army and the Air Force did not experience similar 
 concurrent changes in their structures, although the removal of the PEOs from the Systems 
 Commanders also occurred in those departments. ",0.6822943660722516,58,9
901,"It is interesting to note that both the Army 
 and the Air Force later requested and received waivers to allow the PEOs to report to what was, 
 in essence, positions equivalent to the Navy’s Systems Commanders.",0.6907558092008005,58,1
902,"
 Another major distinction was that the Army and the Air Force had Systems Acquisi-
 tion Review Councils both before and after Goldwater-Nichols, whereas the Navy did not. ",0.608652594300929,58,3
903,"In 
 the Navy, programs wound their way through a set of SYSCOM reviews, through a two-star 
 review in the staff of CNO, and then through the CNO-chaired CEB meeting before finally 
 coming up for decision before SECNAV.",0.9461701778126561,58,1
904,"
 The ASARC and AFSARC boards were co-chaired by, respectively, the Army and Air 
 Force service vice chiefs both before and after Goldwater-Nichols. ",0.4956565853576701,58,1
905,"Thus, each service chief had 
 an important representative in councils dealing with acquisition decisions. ",0.5563252583227423,58,6
906,"Furthermore, our 
 interviews with Air Force and Army retired senior general officers suggest that the principal 
 deputy position was generally filled by a senior uniformed executive (typically a three-star gen-
 eral) in each of the secretariat acquisition offices and that this individual played a major role in 
 the selection of acquisition personnel (including the management of the acquisition workforce) 
 and had the distinct function of briefing the service chief on all matters of acquisition interest 
 prior to his attendance in any structured meeting with the department’s secretary.",0.9506140473528137,58,5
907,"
 With the passage and eventual implementation of Goldwater-Nichols, the Navy acquisi-
 tion programs no longer went through the following organizations or reviews:
 • the Systems Commanders
 • the two-star CNO staff board
 • the CEB.
 To fill their place, the Navy Program Decision Meeting, chaired by ASN (RD&A), was cre-
 ated. ",0.9359081404724159,58,5
908,"Although CNO staff flags were invited to these meetings, the meetings were held at the 
 behest and schedule of the ASN (RD&A), and our interviews indicate that they were poorly 
 attended by Navy flag officers. ",0.7203624119244918,58,8
909,"This led to the perception that the service chief and his staff 
 were isolated from those acquisition functions. ",0.6267345581281093,58,1
910,"We can thus infer that the Goldwater-Nichols 
 Act had greater ramifications for the Navy than for the other services.",0.6275469824238379,58,10
911,"

 CHAPTER FIVE
 How Navy Implementation Affected Acquisition
 This chapter describes four major consequences of the manner in which DoN implemented the 
 Goldwater-Nichols Act. ",0.9272420988337027,58,9
912,"The first is the rise of exclusive civilian control of the acquisition pro-
 cess and the attendant military disenfranchisement. ",0.560263732707886,59,9
913,"The second is the loss of a blended work-
 force. ",0.4675374732643051,59,0
914,"The third is the separation of the “line” (i.e., naval officers who have operational assign-
 ments that lead to their promotion and success in the Navy) from the acquisition process. ",0.7364523244896255,59,8
915,"The 
 fourth is both the continuing search to restore the balance and the unintended consequences 
 of the manner in which the current DoN leadership has chosen to attempt to reintegrate the 
 operational naval officers (line officers) into the acquisition process.",0.741328448043798,59,7
916,"
 Increasing Civilian Control of the Acquisition Process: Constructing an 
 Impenetrable Wall
 During the conference leading up to enactment of Goldwater-Nichols, Senator Nunn stated 
 that he had been “concerned that we not create an impenetrable wall between the staffs of 
 the Service Secretary and the Service Chief.” ",0.7928487997151873,59,1
917,"1  In our interviews with senior Navy and OSD 
 officials directly involved in implementing Goldwater-Nichols, 2  we found that most of these 
 officials came to share this concern, beginning either when the act was passed or later. ",0.856927408067105,59,6
918,"In fact, 
 of the 25 former and current civilian and uniformed officials we interviewed (including those 
 in the Air Force and the Army), all but two had no doubt that a wall had in fact been built 
 between operational officers and acquisition officials.",0.7785903931135657,59,1
919,"
 In terms of our senior-level interviewees, only one—a former USD (AT&L)—believed 
 that a minimal amount of separation between military and civilian leadership resulted from 
 implementation of Goldwater-Nichols. ",0.7492882772591175,59,8
920,"Moreover, he regarded this separation as constructive 
 in that it contributed to creative tension and led to a more efficient use of resources. ",0.6771467269429503,59,0
921,"In short, 
 he believed the service chiefs could still influence acquisition decisions. ",0.49149265422308464,59,9
922,"Similarly, an Air Force 
 civilian executive with a rich background in acquisition matters did not believe that the mili-
 tary leadership was disadvantaged by the separation of the military requirements community 
 from their acquisition brethren. ",0.6685501525029292,59,1
923,"However, the remaining interviewees were much less sanguine 
 about the nature of the outcome.",0.43046340949943146,59,0

 2  These interviewees included a former CNO, a former SECNAV, a former Navy General Counsel, a former ASN (RD&A), 
 and two former Under Secretaries of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.",0.6994257041313102,59,3
926,"
 46    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 ",0.7070990017026073,59,0
927,"According to a former principal deputy ASN (RD&A), the acquisition community elimi-
 nated roles in the acquisition process traditionally filled with staff from OPNAV. ",0.6189271867886152,60,5
928,"A former 
 CNO reported that he himself felt excluded from the acquisition process, as did all the senior 
 officers of all ranks and career fields whom we interviewed. ",0.5915116261441139,60,8
929,"One former USD (AT&L), who 
 came to believe that the service chiefs and Combatant Commanders were now too far removed 
 from the entire acquisition process, thought it essential that service chiefs become more 
 involved in procurement planning, especially in helping to set realistic performance require-
 ments to make trade-off decisions during program development. ",1.2049865156924493,60,9
930,"Both Under Secretaries of 
 Defense (AT&L) we interviewed believed that establishing a four-star vice chief as co-chair of 
 the Service Acquisition Board could overcome the growing divide between a military-based 
 requirements process and a civilian-based acquisition process. ",0.7791115398723153,60,3
931,"In this scenario, the vice chief’s ",0.12174604160173116,60,0
932,"
 role would be similar to that of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in his role as co-chair of 
 the Defense Acquisition Board.
 ",0.5162401109571263,60,1
933,The DoN leadership is not blind to this problem. ,0.5997970648454084,60,0
934,"It has attempted to break down the bar-
 riers between the CNO’s staff and the secretariat with regard to requirements and acquisition. ",0.6413453819215206,60,8
935,"
 The Navy Gate System, initiated in SECNAVNOTE 5000 (2008), is the latest effort to link 
 the acquisition process and requirements process. ",0.5794998500070956,60,6
936,"The system, shown in Figure 5.1, established 
 a six-gate process (the gates are the numbers in the yellow circles) in which each gate represents 
 a formal decision point at which the costs and benefits of a particular weapon system program 
 are evaluated. ",0.8893780417912556,60,7
937,"The vertical dotted line that separates the first three decision gates from the last 
 three represents a division: The first three gates are supposed to be managed on the require-
 ments side, 3  and the last three gates are to be managed on the acquisition side. ",0.6035581018730775,60,7
938,"4  That the dotted 
 line reinforces the notion of separation and Senator Nunn’s “impenetrable wall” seems to have 
 escaped notice.",0.4016134677709431,60,4
939,"
 A Blended Workforce and the Engagement of Operational Ofﬁcers in the 
 Business of Acquisition
 A principal motive of the Goldwater-Nichols Act was to improve the U.S. military’s ability to 
 fight in a more joint manner; consequently, joint considerations must inform not only weapon 
 systems but also officer experience and training. ",1.0262578942258018,60,9
940,"All of the senior-level officials we interviewed 
 reported that they had believed, at the time of Goldwater-Nichols implementation, that there 
 was a need for better communication among the military departments and for more joint col-
 laboration in operations. ",0.8582351556366613,60,5
941,"However, an unintended consequence of requiring officers to serve in 
 a joint duty assignment to achieve flag or general officer rank was the migration of line officers 
 away from the acquisition process because of the pressure of satisfying additional demands 
 during a career whose length did not expand to accommodate these additional demands.",0.8161554039119139,60,8
942,"
 This migration became a particular concern in DoN because the department had, over 
 time, maintained a blended workforce in its acquisition processes. ",0.6753584926864641,60,9
943,"Before Goldwater-Nichols, 
 a mix of Navy and Marine Corps officers and technically oriented civilians were working 
 across the material establishment. ",0.6139365487186546,60,8
944,"Program offices, SYSCOMs, laboratories, and field activities 
 3  Specifically, they are managed by the Deputy CNO for Integration of Capabilities and Resources in Washington, D.C., 
 and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Programs and Resources, CNO/CMC, in OPNAV/Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps. ",0.9101146579608874,60,3

 were generally managed by military officers who rotated into the material establishment from 
 operational billets and brought a wealth of real-world fleet experience to these positions. ",0.820233468226786,60,9
947,"They 
 joined highly skilled engineers and scientists who, working together with former line officers, 
 developed and procured the nation’s naval weapons systems.",0.6083512812344514,61,2
948,"
 After the implementation of Goldwater-Nichols and the subsequent creation of the acqui-
 sition workforce there arose a formulaic career path for those whose intent was to work in 
 acquisition. ",0.6588385588783991,61,9
949,"Although this path created incentives for the civilian element of the workforce, it 
 also created significant differences between the civilian and the uniformed workforces. ",0.5374065432192872,61,7
950,"First, 
 the two workforce groups had completely different chains of command and, consequently, 
 were situated in different performance evaluation and promotion structures. ",0.7058630668496821,61,7
951,"The new work-
 force structure also demanded new educational mechanisms to prepare individuals for careers 
 in the acquisition workforce. ",0.7596422283602863,61,9
952,"The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) was established with 
 a heavy civilianized structure and outlook. ",0.5959676847977036,61,2
953,"The agility of acquisition was slowed by this new 
 institutional training, and the requirement that military personnel participate in DAU courses 
 heavily affected military career assignment and rotation.",0.9141237797017385,61,9

 48    The Perfect Storm: ",0.8152481144737264,61,2
960,"The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 The civilianization of the workforce was accelerated by an unintended consequence of the 
 Goldwater-Nichols emphasis on joint warfighting to satisfy promotion requirements. ",0.7778031773557362,62,9
961,"Before 
 Goldwater-Nichols, officers had more time to rotate through positions related to both the 
 operational realm and the material management process, giving those officers a deeper under-
 standing of the civilian side of the acquisition process. ",0.6921286827505496,62,9
962,"With the rigid requirement of joint duty 
 service, however, officers no longer had time to rotate between operational duty assignments 
 and material management assignments if they wanted to achieve flag or general officer rank in 
 an operational role. ",0.7912565290643426,62,8
963,"Furthermore, those who now chose to devote their energies to acquisition 
 saw their operational experience decline relative to officers who served only in line assignments, 
 which meant that the former lost some of their credibility when it came time to weigh in on the 
 value of a particular performance requirement, for example. ",0.8407205219438774,62,7
964,"Many of the acquisition positions 
 became “restricted” line or engineering duty officers/aerospace duty officers. ",0.593102728519338,62,8
965,"As the number of 
 officers serving in acquisition roles decreased, there emerged a sense that the acquisition process 
 “belonged” to the largely civilian material establishment rather than to the operations or line 
 community. ",0.7452567836036749,62,9
966,"Our interviews with senior Army and Air Force officers reveal the same patterns 
 in those services. ",0.5169743253602882,62,1
967,"Almost to a person, our interviewees remarked on the need to create an incen-
 tive for senior line officers to serve in acquisition roles. ",0.5875941460173686,62,8
968,"We do not mean to imply that there is 
 no role for restricted duty officers in the acquisition workforce. ",0.6438634546999045,62,8
969,"However, a blended workforce 
 should contain officers with warfighting training and perspective to ensure that a rich mix of 
 talent is available to the acquisition leadership.",0.8422778378812936,62,9
970,"
 Unintended Consequences
 The Navy Gate System, with its large, structured set of meetings and briefings, needed to 
 be established because DoN’s acquisition instructions explicitly left the uniformed Navy out 
 of the processes. ",0.8545564235383837,62,9
971,"Nonetheless, Senator Nunn’s wall still stands—another unintended conse-
 quence of Goldwater-Nichols implementation in the Navy.",0.5189911076518253,62,0
972,"
 In SECNAVINST 5400 series, the applicable reference to CNO and CMC is that ASN 
 (RD&A) “shall provide such staff support ",0.8934735145295495,62,5
973,"[as] each consider[s] necessary to perform his duties 
 and responsibilities.” ",1.0007025775697698,62,6
974,5  There is no mention of any other responsibility for the service chiefs. ,0.3993891552716445,62,1
975,"Our 
 interviewees indicated that, when Goldwater-Nichols was passed, the uniform Navy offered 
 a three-star deputy to ASN (RD&A). ",0.4292981354521966,62,2
976,"However, that offer was refused, and a senior civilian 
 executive was installed in that position. ",0.47707632077268847,62,8
977,"Since then, a mix of Senior Executive Service personnel 
 and officers with one to three stars has filled that position. ",0.5118816160729117,62,8
978,"But the DoN acquisition decision 
 boards never had the uniformed Navy in any leadership position. ",0.6024774597892866,62,1
979,"In both the Army and the 
 Air Force, the vice chiefs of each service at one time either chaired their acquisition decision 
 boards or, in more-recent times, co-chaired those boards. ",0.626732530631652,62,1
980,"The reason this is important is that 
 the co-chairmanship gives the senior uniformed leadership an opportunity to demand and get 
 information from the acquisition chain of command, starting with the PM and going up to 
 the PEO. ",0.7133117535625685,62,8
981,"That information flow is important to the decision process because it provides an 
 understanding of what is happening in the program. ",0.732184827621071,62,7

 formed Navy to see the consequences of its “requirements” process and the effect of changes

 desirable effect. ",0.5291246482714996,63,7

 of operational officers who understood the acquisition process. ",0.7546047772303992,63,7

 CHAPTER SIX
 Conclusions, Recommendations, and Issues That Warrant Further 
 Study
 Changes that affect the culture and processes of large bureaucratic organizations are always dif-
 ficult to implement. ",1.2569926915622678,63,7
990,"Because of their organization and their purpose, military establishments 
 are the most difficult to change and change quickly. ",0.8533073238885762,64,7
991,"In the case of the defense establishment 
 in the 1980s and 1990s, change was imposed by legislation that focused on “fixing” myriad 
 perceived and real problems but was created without a clear understanding of the consequences 
 of these fixes. ",1.0531970178371064,64,7
992,"In retrospect, it seems that many of the relevant interrelationships were not well 
 understood. ",0.39293595482650223,64,0
993,"Since Goldwater-Nichols, many changes have been made in both statute and 
 regulation to deal with “just one more” problem overlooked by previous reforms. ",0.8479709436778621,64,0
994,"It is interest-
 ing to speculate about what the protagonists would have done differently if they were given a 
 glimpse of the results. ",0.4213386108622943,64,0
995,"But that would not be a particularly useful exercise because the problems 
 of the day were real, and no one today is contemplating reversing what has been done. ",0.489122866283659,64,0
996,"Rather, 
 we must sift through the results of actions taken over time and see what may practically be 
 done to address the current concerns that informed the core of our inquiry.",0.8730322358951755,64,7
997,"
 ",0.0,64,-1
998,"The various acquisition-related statutes that have been passed in the last two and a half 
 decades reflect the changing perceptions of members of Congress about the nature of DoD’s 
 operational problems and its stewardship of the public monies and trust. ",0.8575230574004223,64,7
999,"Likewise, percep-
 tions of intent have governed the promulgation of regulations to effect that legislation. ",0.4412959170695918,64,0
1000,"Our 
 research strongly suggests that the intent of Goldwater-Nichols was not clearly understood and 
 that there was a significant amount of interpretation, some of it self-serving, in promulgating 
 related military instructions, directives, and regulations. ",0.8575739319130171,64,7
1001,"It is clear that many, despite their 
 reservations, pressed forward anyway because the mandate for change was clear. ",0.6978601467740863,64,0
1002,"It is also clear 
 that DoN, because of its earlier resistance, was directed to proceed by higher authority with an 
 even more restrictive interpretation than necessary, and did so. ",0.7332282448662185,64,0
1003,"This letter-of-the-law approach, 
 taken despite reservations among the leadership, resulted in a DoN implementation of the act 
 that differed from that of the Army and the Air Force.",0.8989821768554422,64,1
1004,"
 Senator Nunn did not seek a rigid divide between the civilian and military leadership. ",0.5883803357663694,64,0
1005,"
 The Army and the Air Force have managed to avoid that divide, to a certain degree, even 
 while facing the same statutory and directive constraints that challenge DoN. That leads us to 
 conclude that the approach taken by DoN is more malleable than believed. ",1.005189349698477,64,9
1006,"Also, the de facto 
 exclusion of offices with an operational focus from the acquisition/material management pro-
 cess is not healthy. ",0.6864673463788022,64,9
1007,"Finally, to achieve the results of the process improvements discussed in the 
 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review Report , we need our best minds working together to solve 
 problems, not sequentially engaging issues through choreographed organizational engage-
 52    The Perfect Storm: The Goldwater-Nichols Act and Its Effect on Navy Acquisition
 ments. ",1.1230534102379384,64,7
1008,"Accordingly, we present the following specific recommendations and suggest several 
 areas that would benefit from further study.",1.1910900305926486,65,7
1009,"
 The DoN should
 • Change applicable DoN Directives to undo the isolation conveyed by the Navy Gates 
 Process and articulate a coherent and continuing role for the service chiefs across the 
 range of the acquisition process that is more like those of the other military departments.",0.8640643755519852,65,9
1010,"
 • Create an acquisition oversight body co-chaired by ASN (RD&A) and the Vice Chief of 
 Naval Operations (and, in discussions of Marine Corps systems of priority interest, the 
 Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps).",0.7206598568002278,65,3
1011,"
 • Create desirable career opportunities for officers of the line in the material establishment.",0.7114935561151525,65,7
1012,"
 Areas for further study are
 • best principles and approaches to expand and rebalance the acquisition workforce to 
 enable informed collaboration in the requirements and resources processes
 • granting joint duty credit for officers in large acquisition programs, as suggested by the 
 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review Report  (which recommends “[r]ecognizing joint experi-
 ence whenever and wherever it occurs” 1 )
 • appropriate changes in officer assignments to create enhanced senior officer opportunities 
 in acquisition.",1.2997882924888375,65,9
1013,"
 In closing, we note that the wall between the service secretary and the service chief 
 remains a concern among policymakers to this day. ",0.4634688221139861,65,2
1014,"The following recommendation appeared 
 in a recent House Armed Services Committee document:
 The Department [of Defense] and Congress should review and clarify the Goldwater-
 Nichols Act’s separation between acquisition and the military service chiefs to allow 
 detailed coordination and interaction between the requirements and acquisition pro-
 cesses and to encourage enhanced military service chief participation in contract 
 quality assurance.",1.272735732502443,65,3
1015,"
 The Panel is concerned that the divide established in the Goldwater-Nichols Act between 
 acquisition and the military service chiefs has become so wide that it hinders both the 
 acquisition and requirements process. ",0.8619249858329219,65,3
1016,"While the fundamental construct in the Goldwater-
 Nichols Act, correctly assigned lead responsibility for acquisition to the Department’s civil-
 ian leaders, the act should be clarified to ensure that the requirements process that must 
 coordinate with all categories of the defense acquisition system freely interacts with the 
 acquisition process. ",0.9674078880780722,65,9
1017,"The service chiefs should also be given greater authority and respon-
 sibility to oversee contract quality assurance especially for contracts that are highly opera-
 tional in nature. ",0.918110762978492,65,9

 Conclusions, Recommendations, and Issues That Warrant Further Study    53
 On July 27, 2010, the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel chaired by former Sec-
 retary of Defense William J. Perry and former National Security Advisor Stephen J. Hadley 
 stated, “The Panel believes that the fundamental reason for the continued under performance 
 in acquisition activities is fragmentation and accountability for performance.” ",1.2024106105163428,65,10
1021,"3  The main thrust 
 of this paper is precisely the same: The military requirements community and the civilian-run 
 acquisition community need to come together to share the authority and responsibility for the 
 performance of the requirements and acquisition system in DoD. Like President Reagan, the 
 House Committee and the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel believe that the 
 wall should be torn down.",0.8822580513257668,66,9

0," Acquisition RebAlAncing:  
 Recommendations for Smart, Efficient 
 & Effective Defense Procurement    
 To:  Members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees
  
 Dear Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Inhofe, Chairman McKeon, Vice Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith,
 Thank you for the opportunity to provide the Aerospace Industry Association’s (AIA) perspective on needed improvements to the Defense Acquisition 
 System. ",0.9199528072660292,1,0
1," Founded in 1919 with roots that go back to the Wright Brothers, AIA is the nation’s pre-eminent association of manufacturers and suppli-
 ers of civil, military and business aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aircraft systems, space systems, aircraft engines, missiles, and related components, ",0.5650294167998334,2,0
2,"
 equipment, services and information technology. ",0.5315109029399468,2,2
3," We are proud to advocate on behalf of an industry that directly employs more than one million 
 workers and supports another 2.53 million jobs in all 50 states; total aerospace sales were $273.1 billion in 2013.",0.5554757935016713,2,0
4,"
 ",0.0,2,-1
5,"The current acquisition system is archaic, difficult to navigate and costly to operate. ",0.7042884208834859,2,0
6,"Your leadership in focusing Congress’ attention on the need to 
 rebalance how DOD conducts the business of modernizing and equipping our forces has come at a critical juncture. ",1.1627778008898408,2,0
7," The time is right to institute 
 common sense solutions and long overdue reforms. ",0.799793321820103,2,0
8," 
 To more efficiently and economically support our military, the aerospace and defense industry has been leading initiatives to streamline internal prac-
 tices and reduce costs. ",0.8783235704428608,2,6
9," Without acquisition reform, continued progress solely through industry-initiated efficiencies will become more challenging to 
 realize in these tight fiscal times. ",0.7906465009660842,2,0
10," Optimizing the use of appropriated dollars for military systems – getting the best value from every resource – is a 
 fundamental commitment that requires both government and industry dedication. ",1.0419123687296812,2,6
11,"
 In addition to reducing costs, acquisition reform is vital to the long-term sustainment of a strong and viable defense industrial base. ",1.0381672251303213,2,6
12," The way we 
 produce systems and conduct business has changed. ",0.9140052521353841,2,0
13," Today’s major weapon systems are highly integrated assemblies of hardware, software and 
 intellectual property, engineered and built by hundreds of companies encompassing the military unique and the commercial supplier base. ",0.7078983224666741,2,0
14," The very 
 nature of the acquisition system needs to adapt to today’s business environment. ",0.6084013071390726,2,0
15," The following principles underpin our perspective on acquisi-
 tion rebalancing: optimizing the use of scarce government resources; allowing industry the ability to execute more quickly and more efficiently; and 
 providing greater opportunity for industry to deliver the technologies, products and services our nation demands. ",1.0809021402507553,2,6
16," Rebalancing acquisition to reflect 
 today’s realities and positioning for future success are critical to our nation.",0.6452348879400336,2,0
17,"
 Four broad areas are first and foremost on our list of issues to tackle:  audits; commercial items; protection of intellectual property; and industry en-
 gagement in the rule making process. ",0.801791008137861,2,2
18," 
 Audits
 Over the past decade, the number of regulations has grown substantially. ",0.4768645578272891,2,2
19," With these new regulations come requirements for a more exhaustive 
 compliance regime that seeks to mitigate all risk of misconduct and malfeasance. ",0.6038864776185253,2,8
20," This compliance regime is costly to both industry and government, 
 yet its benefits are difficult to quantify. ",0.7598411812319611,2,6
21," Audits have become more complex, requiring more government and industry personnel to complete them. ",0.8744132944699273,2,5
22," 
 This complexity often adds time to completing the audits, delaying contract awards, impacting delivery schedules and key milestones as well as 
 contract closeouts. ",0.8230570874433855,2,5
23," 
 The war fighter feels these delays when equipment, services and parts essential to operations and readiness aren’t there when needed. ",0.7186640270256094,2,0
24," Industry also 
 feels the effect of delay. ",0.39863327409413135,2,0
25," The uncertainty makes seeking financing more difficult for smaller firms who need predictable revenue forecasts to support 
 their operations and financial stability. ",0.7778177068965477,2,6
26," The large backlog in incurred cost audits and contract closeouts affects payment, delaying critical revenue for 
 firms without sufficient internal capital to wait it out. ",0.724157021298646,2,3
27,"Clearing the audit backlog, reducing excessive documentation requirements, eliminating redun-
 dant audit and surveillance activity and focusing auditors’ efforts on risk and materiality would be positive steps in removing barriers to industry’s 
 participation in acquisition.",1.0575449552377405,2,5
28,"
 Commercial Items
 DOD’s commitment to the acquisition of, and stated preference for, commercial items is plagued by inconsistencies which creates an uncertain and 
 difficult environment for industry to navigate. ",0.5128227511128034,2,6
29," Increased use of DOD unique or specific requirements stresses the supply chain and dissuades com-
 mercial suppliers from participating. ",0.8148392187239423,2,6
30,"Uneven interpretations of the definition of commercial items, as well as concern whether ‘of a type’ modifications 
 are outside that definition, convert an otherwise straightforward commercial purchase as envisioned under the statute, into a DOD unique one. ",0.661395394807148,2,8
31,"  
 The advantages of using commercial items and commercial business practices are essentially sacrificed in order to obtain excessive data rights as 
 well as unneeded certified cost and pricing data from suppliers, and seek to impose compensation limits that do not reflect documented commercial 
 standards. ",0.9845527506103586,2,7
32,"The benefits of acquiring commercial items are well documented, and include leveraging a wide array of products and technologies result-
 ing from private investments in research, development, intellectual property and other values that are not captured in item-specific cost and pricing 
 data. ",0.9625929300971778,2,6
33,"

 http://www.aia-aerospace.org/
 In addition to accessing a broad industrial base, DOD also accrues the benefit of being one of many customers – ‘sharing’ a common product 
 support infrastructure, parts inventories, supply chain and engineering to overcome parts obsolescence. ",0.6712700016628507,2,0
34,"Inclusion of mandatory non-commercial 
 contract requirements, however, ripples from the prime through the subcontractor base. ",0.8028994270116171,2,7
35,"Any gains that could be realized are forsaken when DOD 
 specific contracting approaches are employed for commercial items. ",0.5317575046512708,2,6
36," Do not impose rules, regulations and practices making it more difficult for DOD 
 to buy commercial items. ",0.703247126397579,2,4
37," 
 Protection of Intellectual Property
 To enable competition and to sustain products throughout their life cycle, DOD seeks broad intellectual property (IP) rights. ",0.7870537395707654,2,2
38," While competition and 
 long term sustainment options are important and laudable objectives, DOD policies advocating for broad IP rights to privately developed technologies 
 are fundamentally incompatible with corporate business strategies and dissuade private investment. ",0.8709117807740628,2,6
39," Business strategies rely on a reasonable return 
 on investment for, as well as the competitive advantage inherent in, their development of intellectual property. ",0.6799329685926471,2,6
40," 
 Collectively, statutory and regulatory changes made in the recent past have clouded the IP protections afforded to commercial items and their 
 underlying technologies. ",0.7680462837252495,2,2
41, These changes have had the unintended consequence of constraining competition instead of promoting it. ,0.6082605087477845,2,3
42," To ensure the 
 competitive playing field is not distorted, institute and confirm appropriate IP protections; doing so will enable increased competition, more opportu-
 nity to leverage private investment, and result in a more robust and healthy contractor community and supply chain.",0.914954524607804,2,6
43,"
 Industry Engagement
 Engaging experts, stakeholders, and interest groups in the formulation of Federal rules helps regulators understand the ramifications of the broad 
 public purposes they intend to achieve. ",0.6745266424831289,2,0
44," Implementation opportunities, alternative solutions and the cost and benefit of rules are all best understood 
 through full engagement. ",0.8716589400949231,2,6
45," 
 The Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972) was intended to ensure agencies receive the benefit of relevant experience through a publically acces-
 sible process. ",0.879020993537733,2,2
46," Today, however, FACA is being portrayed as disallowing the open dialogue it was intended to secure. ",0.3839342239793535,2,0
47," ‘Asked and answered’ style 
 meetings or public hearings are generally presentation heavy and dialogue short. ",0.4371325414234059,2,0
48," Regulations about issues of critical importance to industry, such as 
 counterfeit parts, are being devised without a fulsome airing of both government and industry viewpoints and perspectives. ",0.7509919508512475,2,0
49," Opportunity to under-
 stand the risks and the rewards before regulations are implemented is lost. ",0.6557772461259453,2,3
50,"
 These recommendations do not cover all of our suggestions; instead they are offered as a starting point. ",0.7013043962601135,2,0
51," In addition to the four areas outlined in this 
 letter, I’ve enclosed a white paper and two tables with many more specific recommendations. ",0.7445912154860742,2,0
52,"We look forward to meeting with the committees to 
 discuss our recommendations and to sharing additional information with you and your staffs throughout the summer and fall. ",0.7412606473897078,2,0
53," 
 Again, thank you for leading this critical dialogue. ",0.5609823044620311,2,0
54," We appreciate your consideration of this information and look forward to continuing to work with 
 you to rebalance the acquisition system. ",0.8065167252704339,2,0

 the Department of Defense (DoD) must change 
 how it acquires weapon systems and services. ",0.9071212168174942,2,0
59," 
 there is growing recognition from DoD leader-
 ship, congress and the defense industry that it is 
 time to revise the overly complex and burdensome 
 system that drives unnecessary cost into programs 
 and will soon make them unaffordable as defense 
 budgets decline.",1.0356273821009119,3,6
60,"
 Making the acquisition system more economic and more 
 responsive has been an elusive target. ",0.7790435390972184,3,0
61," The challenges of 
 time-to-delivery and product cost persist despite all at-
 tempts to reform the acquisition system over the last 40 
 plus years. ",0.910873939315957,3,6
62," It’s time to stop tweaking the edges and bring 
 the acquisition system into balance, starting with these core 
 principles:
 •  Have trust and confidence in the U.S. military and the 
 aerospace and defense industry’s ability to deliver together 
 outstanding technologies that keep our nation safe.",0.6787541391777077,3,0
63,"
 •  Balance oversight so that all parties are treated fairly and 
 allow oversight functions to consume only the resources 
 needed to mitigate risks of poor performance and malfea-
 sance.",0.9991114591490329,3,5

 •  Protect the nation’s economic and national security by 
 developing and implementing cohesive defense industrial 
 base strategies.",0.8908445805658257,3,0

 introduction
 6
 A fundamental reorganization of DOD’s acquisition commu-
 nity is needed. ",0.5223662239930548,3,0
74, Why? ,0.0,4,-1
75," Answering straightforward questions – 
 ‘Why are we doing this?’ and ‘Is this the right thing to do?’ - 
 has become increasingly difficult for acquisition professionals. ",0.4987929435528263,4,0
76," 
 Policies, procedures, reporting and communication paths are 
 muddied by redundant headquarters staff, ",0.6887584026888527,4,0
77,"all of whom func-
 tion to review, interpret, and critique the work being done on 
 the ground – in the program office.",0.7046714015056946,4,0
78,"
 Accountability and responsibility for acquisition program plan-
 ning, execution and delivery rest, at least on paper, with the 
 Acquisition Executive, the Program Executive Officer (PEO) 
 and the Program Manager. ",0.849526761461951,4,0
79," In reality, this simple manage-
 ment hierarchy is eroded by layers of oversight organizations 
 and officials – none of whom are accountable for decisions 
 and  outcomes. ",0.685495677687174,4,0
80," 
 Program Executive Officers and Program Managers do not 
 control many of the critical resources necessary to success-
 fully deliver programs. ",1.089753677801985,4,6
81," PEOs and Program Managers actually 
 supervise very few people. ",0.6056418990404919,4,0
82," The few people they do manage 
 are often accountable to oversight communities outside the 
 program. ",0.7149090441097518,4,0
83," For example, the program’s financial manager is 
 accountable to the buying command comptroller – not the 
 program manager. ",0.5932227085396469,4,0
84," Budgets are planned, programmed, 
 submitted and approved by requirements communities and 
 service headquarters staff. ",1.0437080167939805,4,2
85," 
 The gap between operational realities – the day-to-day execu-
 tion of acquisition programs – and the ability to proactively and 
 effectively respond has become increasingly complex. ",0.5801927481732974,4,0
86," Coordinat-
 ing up the chain consumes time, expends the energy of talented 
 acquisition professionals, results in delays and often only margin-
 ally improves program outcomes. ",0.7917731345054775,4,6
87,"  
 Organizational culture has grown to be one that is adverse to new 
 and innovative acquisition strategies. ",0.6185636146259146,4,0
88," The independent overseers 
 and advisors (such as root cause analysts, contract administra-
 tors and auditors) are rigidly tied to rules and regulations with little 
 incentive to find alternative strategies within those rules to help 
 programs succeed. ",0.8386036822701612,4,4
89," 
 More and more contract regulations are promulgated under the 
 assumption that standard, repeatable process will make the 
 overall result better – the workforce won’t have to guess, and the 
 industry will have clear requirements. ",1.0096090107511442,4,5
90," Specific business strategies 
 and contract types are dictated by legislation and regulation – not 
 by critical thinking about the elements of a major defense acquisi-
 tion program. ",0.837854229528487,4,6
91," Our recommendations are focused on rebalancing 
 the acquisition system to empower the government and industry 
 acquisition workforce to think collaboratively first, then execute 
 achievable, effective programs.",1.0074521351095342,4,6
92,"
 overall Recommendations:
 Develop an effective acquisition governance model
 7
 •  Revamp the governance process. ",1.0033708455855823,4,6
93," Examine the cost of 
 oversight and assess whether the burden adds real value to 
 the outcome of an acquisition program. ",1.0091798884478402,4,6
94," Demand the logic 
 inherent in the value proposition behind the oversight. ",0.613318528426361,4,0
95," Add 
 the cost of oversight all the way up the chain – buying com-
 mand, service, and osD, along with the cost of independent 
 DoD agencies to program cost and to program budgets ",0.9324929665067481,4,6
96,"so 
 the public has a complete picture. ",0.6794837411992967,4,0
97," 
 •  Give program managers the tools they need to meet their 
 responsibilities – budgets, people, facilities and time.",0.9626548710561769,4,6
98,"
 •  Let program managers buy support from the Defense Con-
 tract Management Agency (DcMA) and the Defense contract 
 Audit Agency (DcAA) – rather than DcMA and DcAA decid-
 ing what the program needs, as well as when and how the 
 requirement is met. ",0.9013194989802457,4,5
99," 
 •  To support the program manager, require that program fi-
 nancial managers are fluent in contract finance, understand 
 the effects that payment structures (such as progress pay-",0.897657469927786,4,5
100,"
 ments and performance-based payments), financial risk and 
 incentives have on performance and the supply chain. ",0.7992861861228785,4,5
101," 
 •  Align independent oversight agents (i.e., audit, contract 
 administration, and testing) with the mainstream program 
 execution process while respecting their independence. ",0.9306796449067698,4,5
102," Re-
 quire the oversight agents to make timely, cost-conscious, 
 risk-based recommendations. ",1.124649115990334,4,5
103," Hold independent oversight 
 responsible and accountable for program delays and cost 
 increases attributable to their actions.",1.0924136306222185,4,4
104,"
 •  Military and civilian personnel assigned to program offices, 
 with the exception of contracting officers, should work for 
 the Program Manager and the Program Executive Officer. ",0.7119829486308288,4,2
105," 
 Functional leadership has a clear role in preparing the ac-
 quisition workforce and should partner with program man-
 agers to develop highly competent acquisition specialists.",0.8836531259551397,4,0
106,"
 •  Give program managers the responsibility to inform and 
 participate in the budget planning process.",0.9597201416909498,4,5
107,"
 RECOMMENDATIONS
 8
 All too often, communication between industry and DOD is stymied by the very rules and regulations intended to protect and level 
 the playing field for U.S. companies. ",0.8641783302558784,4,0
108," 
 As of May 2, 2014, more than 50 changes to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) were pending with 
 DOD. ",0.7448129989472894,5,2
109," Many will be implemented without public discussion through ‘interim rules,’ which are effective upon publication. ",0.6649538299051848,5,2
110," Better 
 Buying Power’s emphasis on data-driven analysis is adding further constraint to dialogue between DOD and industry on acquisi-
 tion reform. ",0.8291960784890603,5,6
111," Demands for quantitative data have become barriers to meaningful exchange on both draft regulations and acquisi-
 tion reform concepts due to industry challenges regarding aggregation of proprietary and sensitive data. ",0.7084347432208976,5,0
112," Additionally, DOD staff 
 regularly interprets the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) as prohibiting discussion of policy and practice issues with indus-
 try associations. ",1.0270474510196326,5,0
113,This practice closes the door to sector-wide observation and consultation between government and industry.,0.4120337910361612,5,0
114,"
 ",0.0,5,-1
115,"In today’s environment, the fear of undue influence has overshadowed the need for information sharing and consultation. ",0.5458758663531617,5,0
116," Closer 
 collaboration with industry on technology needs, acquisition strategies and long-term procurement plans – as well as the potential 
 sale of U.S. military equipment to our allies – would add realism to DOD’s analyses. ",0.8837964492198191,5,6
117," Moreover, insight critical to industrial planning 
 and forecasting would be more easily attained. ",0.7562981191835824,5,0
118," 
 overall Recommendations:
 improve DoD and industry communication and consultation
 9
 •  Establish a joint DOD-Industry Acquisition Board that brings 
 together thought leaders from business, academia, think 
 tanks and government to continually discuss and recom-
 mend ways to strengthen the weapons system acquisition 
 process.",1.026334340551003,5,0
119,"
 •  Foster DOD-Industry engagement by removing the FACA 
 constraints and allowing working groups to address policy 
 and regulatory issues. ",0.9343104744669117,5,0
120," Work with trade associations to 
 facilitate engagement.",0.46784404948721797,5,0
121,"
 •  Consider the value of qualitative assessment and collabora-
 tion on issues and solutions instead of stymieing discussion 
 by demanding unavailable quantitative data. ",0.908892042818509,5,0
122," 
 •  To achieve affordability, provide industry insight into DOD’s 
 long-term strategy and acquisition plans. ",0.8917053227330797,5,6
123," More effective 
 and predictable insight will enable industry to sponsor 
 research and development investments to help maintain our 
 nation’s technological advantage and plan for workforce, 
 plant and material requirements for supporting u.s. and al-
 lied production needs. ",1.0288193601372897,5,6
124,"
 •  Reduce unnecessary and costly regulations and practices. ",1.0409309234299733,5,4
125," 
 Require cost/benefit analysis for all new regulations, includ-
 ing the cost of compliance and the cost of government 
 oversight.",1.0632174798376066,5,5
126,"
 •  Cease the practice of issuing “interim” rules unless there is 
 genuine pressure for immediate implementation. ",0.7557971516499473,5,8
127," the pub-
 lication of proposed rules allows the public to provide input 
 on what is being considered. ",0.8472746257556671,5,2
128," However, interim rules are 
 often published without any industry dialogue. ",0.6543949909013682,5,0
129," this forces 
 industry to comply with a regime it may not fully understand 
 and puts DoD in the position of enforcing an ill-informed re-
 gime for which the consequences are not fully understood. ",0.6072195672059745,5,0
130,"

 Create the future of military technology and capability through 
 an acquisition system with the agility, speed and flexibility to 
 meet emerging needs and threats.",1.0645853039398474,5,0

 DOD is concerned that U.S. technological superiority will be 
 relinquished to other nations, eroding  our current military 
 advantage. ",0.5164431034152678,6,0

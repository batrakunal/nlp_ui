 ndia acquisition reform recommendations
 I.  authority and accountability
 November 14, 2014  
 Dear Chairmen, Ranking Members, and Vice Chairman of the Committees on Armed Services:
 On behalf of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), a non-partisan, non-profit association of nearly 
 1,600 corporate members and 90,000 individual members, we thank the House and Senate Committees on Armed 
 Services for requesting our views on how to improve the Defense Acquisition System. ",0.979238360709336,2,1
14,"In particular, we thank you 
 for your patience as NDIA undertook a thorough, expert-led, and member-driven process to produce the detailed 
 recommendations included in this final report. ",0.858010685983248,3,7
15,"
 In our letter to you on July 10 (at Appendix 1), we conveyed the three themes that characterize our final recom-
 mendations: providing authority to decision makers and holding them accountable for their decisions, matching 
 the resources invested in the Defense Acquisition System to the requirements placed upon it, and vice versa, and 
 making decisions about how to design the Defense Acquisition System based on data and evidence. ",0.9822057858913525,3,7
16,"Those themes 
 have not changed since our interim response to you.",0.6063689544345855,3,9
17,"
 What did change, to a certain extent, was our approach to developing recommendations. ",1.0697638582010238,3,7
18,"As we undertook the ap-
 proach described in our July 10 letter, we learned lessons and used those lessons to adapt our process in appropri-
 ate and helpful ways. ",0.5763068658893464,3,7

27,"Those studies refl ect 12 consistent problem areas 1  in defense acquisition, 
 and the vast majority of those problem areas are addressed in some way by our recommendations. ",0.8348438050550321,4,7
28,"The small 
 handful that are not addressed were left aside either because they were not of interest to our members, the scope 
 of the problem was so broad as to resist clear, specifi c, and actionable recommendations for change, the problem 
 results from what we call “boundary conditions,” that is, from factors outside of our acquisition system uniquely 
 resistant to change, or the problem simply fell prey to the limited resources of time and manpower available to 
 us. ",1.0800797167386915,4,7
29,"Regardless, it is our plan to continue providing ideas, research, and analysis to your Committees in these ar-
 eas, and we do not consider this report our last word on acquisition improvements.",1.1507077979419358,4,4

 through working groups and large group meetings. ",0.8205132220322191,4,7

 and refi ning a set of possible recommendations. ",0.926518199312313,4,7

 presented them to a second large group meeting, we concluded that it would be most productive to take these 
 member-generated approaches and expose them to the thinking of the experts in the Pentagon responsible for 
 each respective area. ",0.8333071047035381,4,7
34,We also wanted to expose them to the congressional staff supporting your work. ,0.7027320245138722,4,11

 terviews helped immensely and allowed us to refi ne our proposals based on what acquisition leaders already had 
 underway. ",0.550063680752347,4,7
36,"Furthermore, Pentagon acquisition leaders and your staff proposed suggestions with merit in their own 
 right, which we subsequently folded into this report.",0.7249018983008884,4,8

 Our foremost conclusion is as simple as it is obvious: we will not reform defense acquisition once and for all nor 
 solve its every problem. ",0.8033118890230271,4,11

 introduction
 Why Has the Defense Acquisition System Proved So 
 Difficult to Fix?
 ",0.5864318087716944,5,11
61,"This question has become a theme in congressional, 
 military, acquisition, and industry circles. ",0.4031585006291572,5,8
62,"Although 
 obviously not the first person to utter the question, 
 Professor J. Ronald Fox of Harvard Business School 
 made it implicit in his historical analysis of the last half 
 century of acquisition reform efforts,  Defense Acquisition 
 Reform, 1960-2009: An Elusive Goal . ",0.7482403797252862,5,9
63,"Over the last year, 
 the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) kicked 
 off its current inquiry into acquisition reform by asking 
 the question more directly in a hearing entitled, “Twenty-
 five years of Acquisition Reform: Where do we go from 
 here?” ",0.6675735350046342,5,8
64,"The Senate Armed Services Committee reflected 
 the theme in its hearing inquiring into the Reform of the 
 Defense Acquisition Process and the Senate Homeland 
 Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s 
 Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations similarly 
 posed the question when it released a compendium of 
 expert views entitled,  Defense Acquisition Reform: Where 
 Do We Go From Here? ",0.6635837031607913,5,9
65," The theme, though consistent, is 
 also cautionary to anyone who believes that acquisition 
 outcomes need to be improved: whatever one might 
 propose has probably been tried before, and probably did 
 not work.",0.809539395435516,5,7
66,"
 Yet those who have sought to answer the question have 
 offered remarkably similar themes and prescriptions for 
 change. ",0.5512930166604847,5,11
67,"In his book, Professor Fox identified a need to 
 change incentives rather than processes. ",0.8531508829426067,5,7
68,"In testimony 
 before HASC, Pierre Chao noted the disconnection 
 between the requirements process meant to define 
 the equipment to be purchased and the acquisition 
 process meant to purchase it. ",0.7191172903547711,5,6
69,"Paul Francis identified the 
 disconnection between acquisition and budget processes. ",0.43092576677936323,5,9
70,"
 Moshe Schwartz addressed the complexity of the Defense 
 Acquisition System. ",0.3734213806905035,5,9
71,"Dov Zakheim focused on problems 
 with the acquisition workforce. ",0.586467252448967,5,10
72,"Each of these key themes 
 was surrounded by similar or even nearly identical insights 
 among expert witnesses in statements reflecting more 
 commonality than difference.",0.47928126495208473,5,11
73,"
 We share many of the views expressed by Fox, Chao, 
 Francis, Schwartz, Zakheim, and many others, including 
 those expressed by our sister Associations in response to 
 the Armed Services Committees’ inquiries: the Aerospace 
 Industries Association, the Professional Services Council, 
 TechAmerica, and the IT Alliance for the Public Sector. ",0.6352111505405192,5,9
74,"
 Furthermore, participants in the NDIA analytical process 
 that produced this report have themselves led or been 
 on panels that produced earlier acquisition reform 
 recommendations, such as the 2007 Report of the 
 Acquisition Advisory Panel and the Defense Business 
 Board’s 2012 report on linking and streamlining the 
 requirements, acquisition, and budget processes.",0.9808156042274568,5,8
75,"
 If so much has been said already, why say it again? ",0.21207778626054893,5,11
76,"As 
 Moshe Schwartz in his testimony quoted Harvey Sapolsky 
 as saying,
 The limited number of available reforms 
 have all been recycled. ",0.6609984158135759,5,9
77,"You can centralize 
 or decentralize. ",0.2569197127620395,5,9
78,"You can create a specialist 
 acquisition corps or you can outsource 
 their tasks. ",0.6247014105376215,5,9
79,"You can fly before you buy or 
 buy before you fly. ",0.2751743389231165,5,11
80,"Another blue-ribbon 
 study, more legislation, and a new slogan 
 will not make it happen.",0.767373309578457,5,11
81,"
 While this statement is true, and the pessimism it 
 reflects will never go out of style in Washington, NDIA 
 believes that the conditions that have strongly resisted 
 transformation of the acquisition system may be more 
 susceptible to change today than at any time in the 
 recent past. ",0.6875326512336649,5,11
82,"The reasons relate to the way in which our 
 constitutional form of government and other factors have 
 created the boundary conditions that hold the Defense 
 Acquisition System in its current state of equilibrium, 
 and how an alignment of interests and views across 
 the branches of our government can thereby deliver 
 meaningful change.",0.7838577407731808,5,7

 Boundary Conditions, Equilibrium, and Entropy in the 
 Defense Acquisition System
 If the government has consistently sought to reform the 
 Defense Acquisition System, but the System has proven 
 resistant to meaningful change and remained more or 
 less in a state of equilibrium, then forces stronger than 
 acquisition law or policy are holding the System in place. ",0.7798942734020728,6,11
91,"
 We refer to those forces as “boundary conditions,” and Jon 
 Etherton detailed an illustrative list of them in prepared 
 testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee 
 (SASC):
 The federal military and civilian personnel 
 systems. ",0.7648867134112973,6,1
92,"The federal personnel hiring and 
 promotion systems for civilian employees 
 and military service members impact the 
 education and experience of acquisition 
 personnel and, in the case of the military, 
 the amount of an officer’s career that is 
 devoted to acquisition versus operational 
 assignments. ",0.8021916973435295,6,1
93,"
 The budgeting and program planning 
 processes. ",0.9948243569705068,6,4
94,"The budget, planning, and 
 programming processes in the federal 
 government dictate decisions about 
 schedules and the availability of resources 
 and have to reconcile a number of 
 competing public policy imperatives, of 
 which cost-effective acquisition is only 
 one. ",1.106266490903411,6,4
95,"The incentives embedded in these 
 processes can have a decisive effect on 
 the structure, size, and pace of technology 
 maturation of federal acquisition programs. ",0.6706239766390678,6,10
96,"
 Industry action. ",0.7849741733605136,6,8
97,"While industry faces a 
 number of barriers to entry into and exit 
 from the federal market, companies’ 
 behavior in the buyer–seller relationship 
 is not dictated solely by changes to federal 
 acquisition policy. ",0.70568997689277,6,6
98,"Other considerations 
 also influence a company’s response 
 to a policy change, such as the need to 
 demonstrate sustained shareholder value 
 to institutional investors. ",1.0121527056567652,6,11
99,"Also, the federal 
 sales of a commercial company may be 
 quite small as a proportion of its total 
 sales in the global marketplace, reducing 
 its willingness to participate in a highly 
 regulated federal marketplace. ",0.7114846866705783,6,11
100,"
 The audit and oversight structure and 
 process. ",0.8162053840808907,6,4
101,"The federal oversight and audit 
 community sometimes judges acquisition 
 decisions based upon a narrow set of 
 data on a single transaction basis when 
 other factors such as the use of individual 
 judgment, innovative approaches, and 
 prudent risk-taking in support an agency’s 
 mission may in fact be more relevant to the 
 overall success of the Defense Acquisition 
 System. ",1.0900541128131662,6,4
102,"
 ",0.0,6,-1
103,"The news media and outside 
 organizations. ",0.29495668260870056,6,9
104,"The independent media 
 and outside organizations’ judgments of 
 the performance of a federal program 
 or agency have a major impact on 
 perceptions and the support of the public 
 and Congress for a given set of policies 
 over time. ",0.9892512392142264,6,3
105," 
 While several of these areas are technically subject to 
 change under the law, their resistance to change reflects 
 either institutional prerogatives rooted in the Constitution 
 or prerogatives of powerful actors in our political process 
 that shape the application of our system of laws more than 
 they are shaped by them. ",0.6899321065679627,6,11
106,"The Framers of the Constitution 
 themselves offered an explanation of the basic defect of 
 our government which ultimately produces the boundary 
 conditions that hold the Defense Acquisition System firmly 
 in place:
 To what expedient, then, shall we finally 
 resort, for maintaining in practice the

 the Constitution? ",0.4588549134601095,7,9
117,"The only answer that 
 can be given is, that as all these exterior ",0.3913628519388672,7,11
118,"
 provisions are found to be inadequate, the 
 defect must be supplied, by so contriving 
 the interior structure of the government 
 as that its several constituent parts may, 
 by their mutual relations, be the means 
 of keeping each other in their proper 
 places…
 [T]he great security against a gradual 
 concentration of the several powers in 
 the same department, consists in giving 
 to those who administer each department 
 the necessary constitutional means and 
 personal motives to resist encroachments 
 of the others. ",0.6891244932591252,7,11
119,"The provision for defense 
 must in this, as in all other cases, be made 
 commensurate to the danger of attack. ",0.41917558819177153,7,11
120,"
 Ambition must be made to counteract 
 ambition. ",0.21385171680281392,7,9
121,"The interest of the man must be 
 connected with the constitutional rights of 
 the place. ",0.41142907430553677,7,11
122,"2
 In each of our “boundary conditions,” and in many others 
 we have not listed, the basic challenge is the misalignment 
 of incentives among and between actors inside and 
 outside the acquisition system, allowing them to work at 
 cross purposes while each pursues his own interests by 
 constitutional means. ",0.6491099589782056,7,6
123,"These misaligned incentives are by 
 constitutional design; they will not be remedied by law or 
 policy. ",0.6075669051865361,7,11
124,"
 Despite having produced the most effective weapon 
 systems and defense capabilities in history, the Defense 
 Acquisition System is characterized by a significant degree 
 of entropy and inefficiency. ",0.6252538189596548,7,7
125,"“Entropy” is another way 
 of saying that a system will tend to achieve equilibrium, 
 or, put colloquially, that “water seeks its own level.” ",0.5285755901120418,7,11

 technology and support from industry. ",0.9239772171949745,8,10

 Solution Proposal:  Acquisition experts frequently debate whether true acquisition reform will result from the use of

 System itself must be changed to more closely resemble rapid acquisition authorities. ",0.8313733935568939,9,10

 them when they do, and hold them accountable if they do not. ",0.8688531783459896,9,10

 cycle (prior to Milestone A) in order for the streamlined process to have an impact. ",0.6850497933838638,9,4

 DSP provides the ability to challenge non-value added regulatory, budget, and policy requirements not based in 
 statute. ",0.8917418872522916,9,2

 added requirements based in law. ",0.8594932622518652,9,2

 Problem Description:   The government acquisition process is growing less open to innovation from non-government 
 funded research and development as well as emerging private sector ways of delivering capabilities. ",0.8610849090528423,18,10

 Root Cause Analysis:  The acquisition workforce is not empowered or incentivized to make use of all available options 
 for acquiring capabilities when making acquisition decisions. ",1.1039107601480944,18,10
365,"Acquisition processes are inflexible with respect to new 
 technologies or emerging ways of acquiring capabilities. ",0.6240396087390482,18,10

 Acquisition processes are structured and driven by a narrow approach to measuring value: getting the lowest price in 
 a single transaction. ",0.8263708974676114,18,7
367,"This approach to measuring value does not account for benefits to the government from savings 
 incurred through overhead cost avoidance, cost avoidance through private investment into research and development, 
 savings from lease versus ownership, and the value of market access to products and services the government could not 
 research and develop with its own funding in a timely manner. ",1.2035859017830874,18,6

 a more cost-effective manner. ",1.0775441071003253,18,4

 Use “State of the Practice” Commercial Technologies
 Solution Proposal:     The Defense Acquisition System could see major improvements in capability and reductions 
 in lifecycle costs when it increases and incentivizes access to technologies and solutions developed outside of the

 The Department of Defense desperately needs to incorporate the “state of the practice” commercial components (which 
 NDIA defines as standard-use contemporary commercial solutions, as opposed to an obsolete commercial solutions or the 
 “state of the art,” cutting-edge commercial solutions) for its major systems. ",0.9104370174305638,18,7
373,"During our process of research and discovery, 
 we came across individuals who claimed it was standard operating procedure for programs to incorporate contemporary 
 commercial components, yet when looking at major systems, NDIA was able to identify obsolete commercial components 
 on major systems, and occasionally parts that had been obsolete for several decades. ",0.8521231991878927,18,7
374,"It costs more to maintain a 
 commercial part that has become obsolete than it does to use its “state of the practice” alternative, and the additional cost 
 increases with time and the rarity of the obsolete part. ",1.2288784526831673,18,6

 Because more than one individual assured us that programs and initiatives are underway to identify and incorporate “state

 Office (GAO) to identify any such existing programs in the Department and evaluate their effectiveness. ",1.1483980691711528,18,4

 establish the case for broadening “state of the practice” commercial component acquisitions, GAO should identify factors

 officials: steer clear of industry unless you are required to engage in dialog. ",0.7679708657543247,24,8

 Furthermore, government-industry conferences, which experts endorse as the best forum for ethical, appropriate, and 
 meaningful government-industry dialog to take place, 8  have faced restrictions following two inexcusably wasteful ",0.7367577323655744,25,6
528,"
 conferences run by the government and involving the exclusive participation of government employees. ",0.5976208830880255,25,11
529,"It merits 
 repeating: the conferences involving intolerable and inexcusable waste identified by the Inspectors General of the 
 Department of Veterans Affairs and the General Services Administration were organized and run by government 
 employees for government employees—not to facilitate the appropriate, legal, and ethical interaction of government 
 purchasing officials with their industry supplier base. ",0.8070202811474588,25,8
530,"9  Ironically, it is government participation in industry conferences 
 that has suffered most in the aftermath. ",0.4063441395317031,25,11
531,"New conference approval restrictions might achieve some modest up-front 
 savings, 10  but even if they do, those savings come at the cost of an acquisition workforce that is significantly less informed 
 about the industry it partners with and purchases from. ",0.8948339517461336,25,6
532,"The dramatically increased oversight and increasing restrictions 
 communicate a clear message to the acquisition workforce: just don’t go. ",1.0112324388992107,25,11
533,"Do not attend government-industry conferences, 
 industry days, or trade shows for market research purposes, regardless of whether or not the taxpayer would ultimately 
 benefit from your dialog with vendors and a greater awareness of market offerings. ",0.6226028057927231,25,6
534,"
 Last, the dialog between government suppliers and government regulators during the rulemaking process could be significantly 
 improved. ",0.6961466711232102,25,6
535,"Acquisition regulators and the suppliers they regulate have a good relationship, but dialog during the rulemaking 
 process is stymied by an overly restrictive interpretation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). ",0.8295674682993749,25,8
536,"The result is that 
 regulators and government suppliers cannot have an honest conversation about the most efficient and effective ways to draft a 
 proposed rule to maximize its implementation while minimizing its cost. ",0.8619193940770994,25,7
537,"Instead, government regulators closely hold all of the 
 details of the rulemaking process until releasing a proposed rule, and then after the rule is proposed, will not engage in dialog 
 as part of the rulemaking process, instead relying on back-and-forth formal written letters until the final rule is completed. ",0.68998350345246,25,6
538,"
 A real conversation between regulators and those they regulate on how best to draft a proposed rule does not presuppose 
 agreement among the parties, only an ability to talk through the details in a way that is impossible when “dialog” is limited to 
 exchanges of written correspondence, which is the character of the current rulemaking process. ",0.7618843187666328,25,11
539,"
  
 Improve Government Market Research
 Solution Proposal:  Former OFPP Administrator Daniel Gordon’s original “Myth Busters” memo debunked the myths that 
 market research and dialog with industry are too administratively burdensome, too time-consuming, and of little value. ",0.7128234742590372,25,11
540,"
 Today, market research is explicitly or implicitly required by at least six separate statutes, 11  but none of them establish 
 a minimum threshold for what constitutes market research. ",0.7730566398326928,25,2
541,"Since it is obvious that procurement experts consider real 
 dialog with industry to be of value, particularly for the purposes of market research, and since market research is already 
 a requirement of law, it makes sense for the Congress to explicitly endorse dialog with industry by making it the essential 
 requirement of performing market research. ",1.091097730079728,25,6
542,"Market research may also include many other activities, but at the very least 
 it should include a handful of verbal discussions with industry representatives to inform whatever other market research 
 activities take place.",0.6517572996686426,25,7
543,"
 8 All three memoranda listed in the prior two footnotes support broadly-attended venues, i.e. conferences, for appropriate and ethical government-industry dialog. ",0.6214555737153602,25,8

 Make it Less Difficult for Government Employees to Attend Conferences When Appropriate
 Solution Proposal:  Regarding government attendance and participation in conferences, including science and 
 technology conferences, conferences that facilitate the interaction of the acquisition workforce with industry, and 
 conferences designed for government market research, applying new restrictions is penny smart but pound foolish. ",0.8965598455417293,28,8

 The two conferences that gave rise to the current restrictive oversight were conferences run by government employees 
 for government employees—they did not involve, nor were they designed for, government-industry dialog. ",0.7438190986485458,28,8

 therefore be replaced by substantially similar provisions should the acquisition laws, regulations, and policies be “zero

 recommends that new statutes also include a standard sunset clause. ",1.1550039334162976,34,2

 Establish a Panel to Review the Full Body of Acquisition Law
 Solution Proposal:  While NDIA believes that a mandated sunset review clause is a controlled way of implementing the 
 Defense Business Board’s recommendation, the best example of an historical statutory review is the so-called “Section 
 800 Panel,” established in the Fiscal Year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act, which gathered a group of experts to 
 review the entire body of acquisition statutes at one time and offer recommendations about what to repeal, what to keep, 
 and what to modify. ",1.3586779783819491,35,3

 Authorize the Retention of Critical, Senior Acquisition Employees
 Solution Proposal:  Through interviews with acquisition leaders, NDIA discovered a desire to make continued service 
 in the acquisition workforce more attractive to retirement-eligible career civil servants. ",0.8578393105539472,39,8
829,"While government pay rates do 
 not typically compare favorably to senior private sector executive positions, this discrepancy worsens as civil servants 
 become retirement-eligible. ",0.5787121344753022,39,8
830,"In these circumstances, civil servants choose between continuing to work in government 
 for their current rate of pay or retiring from government to receive a percentage of their current pay as retirement pay 
 and then potentially also going to work in the private sector if a lucrative opportunity presents itself. ",0.7285251378965646,39,11
831,"As additional years 
 of retirement eligibility accrue, the percentage of retired pay increases, making continued civil service a decreasingly 
 attractive option compared to retiring from government and receiving an additional private sector paycheck. ",0.8595987456245585,39,11

 the authority to allow full payment of both annuities and salary for limited-time appointees under 5 U.S.C.  § 8344(l) 
 (which pertains to the Civil Service Retirement System, CSRS) and 5 U.S.C.  § 8468(i) (which pertains to the Federal

 3) Improve the Management of the Military Acquisition Workforce
 Problem Description:  Acquisition roles are less desirable to the military workforce than operational roles and therefore in 
 some cases may be less attractive to skilled military officers.",0.8146296081064447,48,10
1013,"
 Root Cause Analysis:  Acquisition functions are somewhat non-traditional military roles, and they presently do not offer 
 incentives that could balance out the typical preference among most officers for line or operational military career fields 
 that tend to attract talented individuals to the military, and which also tend to be the most heavily represented in the 
 general and flag officer grades. ",0.7582026123270064,48,10
1014,"
 Hold the Service Chiefs Accountable for the Management of the Military Acquisition Workforce
 Solution Proposal:  At present, the Secretary of Defense is responsible for assuring that the military acquisition corps 
 enjoys at least an equal promotion rate as compared to other military officers of the same Service in the same grade. ",0.6524792532089037,48,1
1015,"
 Rather than limiting this promotion preference to particularly well-qualified military officers in the acquisition workforce, 
 the responsibility should be delegated to the Military Service Chiefs (to further extend their responsibility for the 
 acquisition functions of their Service) and should be extended to all military officers serving in positions covered by the 
 Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA). ",0.8986386000464481,48,1
1016,"As the Defense Business Board’s (DBB) 2012 report on the 
 subject states,  
 The Service Chiefs should lead the military acquisition professionals as they do officers in operational 
 career fields. ",0.7391422310278515,48,1
1017,"They should manage career paths, training, and education that result in highly qualified and 
 experienced professionals.",0.8379637468643367,48,10
1018,"
 Very few outside the Military Departments realize that military personnel serving in the acquisition field 
 are not being managed by the military personnel system that covers all other uniformed personnel. ",0.5752914745312637,48,1
1019,"The 
 current approach does not provide military officers with the requisite experience, skills, and qualifications

 A September 2010 study conducted by the RAND Corporation, “The Perfect Storm” found the 
 implementation of the Acquisition Reforms in the Department of the Navy (DoN) had three undesirable 
 consequences: 
 1. ",0.907151412498574,48,9
1021,"It erected an impenetrable wall between a military-controlled requirements process and a civilian-
 driven acquisition process to the overall detriment of acquisition in DoN. 
 2. ",0.6345149765287028,48,10

 costs to the government and to industry support of the acquisition process.",0.9461210817006248,54,6
1126,"
 Root Cause Analysis:  In a compliance-driven process, audits are seen as key to successful system performance, but 
 current audit requirements exceed Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) capabilities and resources. ",1.089180354376728,54,4
1127,"Recent statements 
 by DCAA leaders indicate that 40 percent of DCAA personnel have five or fewer years or less experience in government 
 auditing, which, when combined with vigorous assertions of audit independence, can lead to wastefully expensive audit 
 practices. ",0.8841435117898583,54,8
1128,"Decentralized DCAA management allows variation in practice and culture among its auditors which can also be 
 unhelpful. ",0.5310914982306305,54,7
1129,"
 Solution Proposal:  Improving the relationship of government auditors with government vendors is one of the greatest 
 challenges in acquisition policy, since auditors must simultaneously look for inaccuracies in vendor reporting or 
 documentation to protect the taxpayer while also avoiding unnecessary waste caused by inefficient audit practices. ",0.9642226667622332,54,7
1130,"Two 
 general principles applied at the level of the individual auditor help to accomplish these goals: first, a risk-based approach 
 to auditing that focuses on materiality, and second, an advisory approach to auditing that focuses on helping vendors come 
 into full compliance rather than an adversarial approach that seeks to identify every possible error in vendor reporting and 
 documentation and penalize them for it.",0.9596128975417689,54,7
1131,"
 The law does not specify these practices, nor should it, since individual auditors ultimately need the flexibility to behave 
 toward the vendor in the manner most befitting the given circumstances, which no law could be flexible enough to capture 
 in its entirety. ",0.8814539551415969,54,6
1132,"Instead, the problem is ripe for oversight and management, and therefore NDIA recommends an approach 
 that combines the two.",1.0360274225864288,54,7
1133,"
 10 U.S.C. §2313a, which establishes an annual reporting requirement for DCAA, should be amended to include a report 
 of DCAA’s efforts to align its audit policies and practices across its various regions. ",1.0981968507881992,54,3
1134,"At the organizational level, increased 
 commonality will encourage organizational learning as the regions connect with each other to identify and adopt best 
 practices and to learn from mistakes.",0.8895785097354478,54,7
1135,"
 Because most audit issues are unique to the company in question, the congressional defense committees should encourage 
 DCAA to create outreach opportunities through meetings with companies, industry trade associations, and other contractor

 Study the Low Price, Technically Acceptable Source Selection Method
 Solution Proposal:  While GAO recently evaluated the government’s application of the Low Price, Technically 
 Acceptable (LPTA) source selection method and found that LPTA is used in accordance with guidance, 22  GAO did 
 not evaluate whether the system-wide nine percent increase in the prevalence of LPTA source selection had changed

 their costs and benefits—largely because the costs are incurred by industry and billed back to the government as overhead

 The so-called “Big Data” revolution of the last ten years or so has made key advances in automating the collection,

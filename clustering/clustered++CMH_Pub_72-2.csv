 Introduction
 World War II was the largest and most violent armed conﬂict in
 the history of mankind. ",0.5156540224146153,1,4
1,"However, the half century that now separates
 us from that conﬂict has exacted its toll on our collective knowledge.",0.3590911099076266,2,11
2,"
 While World War II continues to absorb the interest of military schol-
 ars and historians, as well as its veterans, a generation of Americans
 has grown to maturity largely unaware of the political, social, and mil-
 itary implications of a war that, more than any other, united us as a
 people with a common purpose. ",0.6188811754949987,2,5
3,"
 Highly relevant today, World War II has much to teach us, not only
 about the profession of arms, but also about military preparedness,
 global strategy, and combined operations in the coalition war against
 fascism. ",0.6267954922480534,2,4
4,"During the next several years, the U.S. Army will participate
 in the nation’s 50th anniversary commemoration of World War II. ",0.4596479006522853,2,4
5,"The
 commemoration will include the publication of various materials to
 help educate Americans about that war. ",0.7977832956571735,2,11
6,"The works produced will pro-
 vide great opportunities to learn about and renew pride in an Army
 that fought so magnificently in what has been called “the mighty
 endeavor.” ",0.4746970273556751,2,11

 A Brief History of the U.S. Army in World War II  highlights the
 major ground force campaigns during the six years of the war, offers
 suggestions for further reading, and provides Americans an opportuni-
 ty to learn about the Army’s role in World War II. ",0.6113432844291117,2,4
8,"This brochure was
 prepared at the U.S. Army Center of Military History by Wayne M.
 Dzwonchyk (Europe) and John Ray Skates (Pacific). ",0.6038118498751359,2,4
9,"I hope this
 absorbing account of that period will enhance your appreciation of
 American achievements during World War II. ",0.5232679234483592,2,0

 World War I left unresolved the question of who would dominate
 Europe. ",0.3987123692743558,5,4

 the borders of surrounding countries. ",0.5735202750831153,6,5

 The ultimate goal of Hitler’s policy was to secure “living space” for
 the German “master race” in eastern Europe. ",0.4856605155666581,6,3

 seized the rest of Czechoslovakia by force of arms and then turned

 September 1939, World War II began. ",0.41818578438610576,8,2

 Britain declared war on Germany and mobilized their forces. ",0.3435894307635861,8,9

 known as the Phony War. ",0.4072997369514721,8,11
71,"Nothing happened to indicate that World
 War II would differ signiﬁcantly in style or tempo from World War I. 
 But the years since 1918 had brought important developments in
 the use of tanks. ",0.5791624933249683,8,11
72,"A number of students of war—the British Sir Basil
 Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller, the Frenchman Charles de Gaulle, 
 the American George S. Patton, and the Germans Oswald Lutz and
 Heinz Guderian—believed that armored vehicles held the key to
 restoring decision to the battlefield. ",0.5618441234299584,8,10
73,"But only the Germans con-
 ceived the idea of massing tanks in division-size units, with infantry,
 artillery, engineers, and other supporting arms mechanized and all
 moving at the same pace. ",0.4791053528589628,8,6
74,"Moreover, only Lutz and Guderian re-
 ceived the enthusiastic support of their government. ",0.41163463686868074,8,0
75,"
 In the spring of 1940 their theories were put to the test as Ger-
 man forces struck against Norway and Denmark in April; invaded 
 the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in May; and late in the
 same month broke through a hilly, wooded district in France. ",0.5758113370299289,8,2

 columns sliced through to the English Channel, cutting off British 
 and French troops in northern France and Belgium. ",0.3807440285552358,8,10

 Army, plagued by low morale, divided command, and primitive com-
 munications, fell apart. ",0.451629163666634,8,1
78,"The British evacuated their forces from
 Dunkerque with the loss of most of their equipment. ",0.473154368447811,8,6
79,"The Germans
 entered Paris on 14 June, and the French government, defeatist and
 deeply divided politically, sued for an armistice. ",0.4365989054118931,8,3
80,"The success of the
 German  Blitzkrieg  forced the remaining combatants to rethink their
 doctrine and restructure their armies. ",0.4199258387410035,8,9
81,"
 With his forces occupying northern France and with a puppet
 French government established in the south, Hitler launched the
 Luftwaffe  against the airﬁelds and cities of England to pave the way 
 for an invasion. ",0.616770210468859,8,10

 Hitler to abandon all plans to invade England. ",0.4873350082963775,9,7

 In February Hitler sent troops under Lt. Gen. Erwin Rommel to
 aid the Italians who were fighting against the British in North
 Africa. ",0.4781164678609501,9,10
87,"German forces coming to the aid of the Italians in the
 Balkans routed a British expedition in Greece, and German para-
 troopers seized the important island of Crete. ",0.5045508699842587,9,10

 Hitler turned against his supposed ally, the Soviet Union, with the
 full might of the German armed forces. ",0.376115150350666,9,9

 armies. ",0.37962188007026365,9,9
90,"Despite tremendous losses, Russian military forces withdrew
 farther into the country and continued to resist. ",0.5731223748796572,9,9

 quick victory evaporated, and the onset of winter caught the Germans
 unprepared. ",0.3511666637604659,9,7

 halt, and the Soviets launched massive counterattacks. ",0.3998471913970365,9,6

 offensive the following spring. ",0.5125946274720131,9,7

 Arctic Circle to the Black Sea. ",0.30795436262505615,9,0

 Waging war with the implacable ruthlessness of totalitarian regimes,
 both sides committed wholesale atrocities—mistreatment of pris-

 the Jews, outright genocide. ",0.416531368107289,9,5

 In the United States preparations for war moved slowly. ",0.36430966822495275,9,2

 Philippines seemed a hopeless task. ",0.5622453559440928,9,5
